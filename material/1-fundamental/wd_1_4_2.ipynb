The great thing about learning a language in more-depth like this is that it will make you familiar and comfortable with concepts that will pop-up once more in many other languages as well. For example, the concepts of sets, scopes of variables, constants, types, maps, list comprehensions and much more will be just as relevant (and sometimes even more) in Javascript as they are in Python.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Et Cetera](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/9/) (4 hours)\n","\n","**On docstrings/documentation:** writing documentation for code, while extremely useful, is anecdotally viewed as one of the things that developers are quite reluctant to do (“it's tedious”, \"it's not writing code!”). Recently, however, there is a lot of enthusiasm about using AI to either help write documentation or to have it write functions based on docstrings that you write yourself. Try both approaches to test these capabilities yourself.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## A Note on Using Familiar Techniques\n","\n","At this point, you will have already learnt a lot of different techniques that you can use when coding. In fact, you know so many of them so that you can write complete, complex, working programs without using some of those techniques at all. As a simple example, you will have seen in the CS50 video that it's relatively easy to implement a function that makes a list behave similarly to a set (i.e. it checks if a value is in the list and does nothing if it already exists). As another example, you can also quite easily avoid using command line arguments by simply having users input options inside the program. This may result in a rather common situation where a developer unconsciously chooses their own limited subset of techniques that they can use to achieve almost everything that they need, almost ignoring some of the other techniques. \n","\n","What we suggest, however, is to consciously focus on regularly pushing yourself to use a wide variety of techniques when writing your code, constantly staying curious and versatile. You can do this as easily as just glancing over the video timestamp annotations in CS50P videos from time to time to remind yourself of the wide range of skills that you have already learned. This has multiple benefits:\n","- You will be able to quickly find more simple, effective solutions\n","- In some cases, the “default” set of techniques might not be enough and you will have forgotten all the different alternatives that you could use\n","- It will be much easier to work in teams where other developers might use a different set of techniques than you\n","- It will be extremely useful in interviews, where an interviewer might see something as default and basic for them, even though it can potentially be avoided often. You will avoid situations where not answering those questions could give a wrong impression to the interviewer. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## HackerRank practice (4 hours)\n","The following exercises will cover multiple topics and different difficulties, providing you with an opportunity for general coding practice.\n","\n","[Classes: Dealing with Complex Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/class-1-dealing-with-complex-numbers/problem)\n","\n","[Matrix script](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-script/problem)\n","\n","[Validating UID](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/validating-uid/problem)\n","\n","[Piling Up!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/piling-up/problem)\n","\n","[No Idea](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/no-idea/problem)\n","\n","[Word Order](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/word-order/problem)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","# Direction for further research (1+ hours):\n","- Can you access items in a set by indexing them? E.g. my_set[0]?\n","- What are some other standards and tools for writing documentation? How do they differ between different programming languages?\n","- What are the benefits of functional programming, compared to OOP besides the ones mentioned in CS50P? This can be quite a deep topic that developers debate a lot about!\n","- In Python, if you use functions like map() or filter(), will they necessarily have no side-effects?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5yPxpxXRcajS"}}]}
