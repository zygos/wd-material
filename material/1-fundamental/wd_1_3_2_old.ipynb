It is a tool some developers love and others hate – but most agree that it is very useful and unavoidable in certain situations. Regular expressions have immense capabilities when working with and when you want to find specific patterns in that text. While there are quite a few tools for working with Regular expressions, it is still necessary to have some experience of working with them on your own. CS50P will give a great introduction to that and you will also get to see some websites for practicing regular expressions even further.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P – Regular Expressions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/7/) (3 hours)\n","\n","Note: ChatGPT and other regex-centered online tools are quite good for writing and testing regular expressions. Therefore, many developers will rarely need to fully manually create or understand complex regular expressions themselves. However, it is still very useful and important to learn the core ideas of regular expressions and get some practice so that you are comfortable with them once you do encounter them or so that you could identify where they could be used. Furthermore, you might encounter regular expressions (although usually quite simple ones) in job interviews as well where you won’t be allowed to use external tools.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Interactive Tool for Testing Regular expressions](https://regex101.com/)\n","This is a very commonly used tool for testing the regular expressions that you write or encounter. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Problem Set 7](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/7/) (4 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Further Regex challenges (2 hours)\n","\n","There are multiple ways you can continue to practice regular expressions. Here we list just a few. We do not suggest spending more than 2 hours on them just yet though. Instead, for now, just see how far you can get and try to do them as a fun challenge. If you cannot get very far – that’s quite fine! On the other hand, if you do find working with them interesting and if you have some extra time, you could get back to these challenges every week or two and try to get further each time. This way you will better remember what you have learned and even continue to get better with regular expressions. Even if you do not do such regular practice, however, you will still encounter regular expressions from time to time which should be enough to maintain the basic knowledge level needed.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Hackerrank Regex challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex)\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","# Direction for further research (1+ hours):\n","- How would you escape the escape character itself – the backslash “\\”?\n","- In regex, why can't you use [a-Z] instead of [a-zA-Z] when you want to include all alphabet letters (both lowercase and uppercase)?\n","- What are some of the most common use-cases for regular expressions in web development?\n","- What issues might you encounter if you write your code using the walrus operator?
