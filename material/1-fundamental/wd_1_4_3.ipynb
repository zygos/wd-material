Computer Science is a much broader term encompassing more than just web development, so some of the topics there are not as relevant for our particular course. The C language, for example, while quite fundamental in computer science, is not as important in web development these days. There are a couple of topics that are very useful to know for web developers, however. \n","\n","The first one of such topics is algorithm analysis. While most junior web developers are unlikely to build complex algorithms yet, it is still very useful to get both an intuitive and a more technical understanding of what may cause significant inefficiencies so that you know what to avoid (and don’t accidentally build programs that take ridiculously long to run!). Also, you may encounter some basic questions regarding algorithms in job interviews as well, so it's worthwhile getting some basic knowledge in them. \n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50x – Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/fall/weeks/0/) (0.2 hours)\n","Only section “Algorithms” (56:00-1:05:55) – this revises the first algorithm that you may already be aware of. It has a specific name, even though it was not mentioned yet in this video – binary search. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50 - Algorithms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/fall/weeks/3/) (3 hours)\n","Part of this video will explain the algorithms in the programming language C. Do not worry – by now, your knowledge should be enough to read basic algorithms with just a bit of explanation in other languages as well. Furthermore, it will be quite interesting to compare how cumbersome some of the common functionalities are in C when compared to Python (e.g. string comparison). This will give an initial understanding of just how convenient Python is compared to many other languages. This does not mean that C is obsolete, however, far from it! If you would like, you can explore the benefits of different programming languages and you will find that C is still used a lot in various applications (e.g. Python itself was basically built using C!).\n","\n","To be clear – in the parts that talk about C, do not focus too much on syntax or subtleties of how C works. As long as you are able to follow the logic, that is enough for this lecture. You are even advised to play these parts at a higher speed if you are short on time. \n","\n","If you already know C from before and are in a hurry, you may even skip the part from 29:00 to 59:10.\n","\n","## [Timing your Programs - cProfile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZzb_Wpag_M) (1 hour)\n","A popular tool in Python to analyze the speed of your programs (also known as *profiling*) is a library called cProfile. This video gives a great introduction on how to use it. It is very useful when you are writing more complex programs and are unsure about which parts of it need to be optimized. It is also one of the many possible ways to time specific functions that you want to analyze for time efficiency. \n","\n","## Experimenting with Algorithms (6 hours)\n","\n","Besides the 3 sorting algorithms you have just learned about (selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort) there is a fourth one that is just as popular – quicksort. In most cases, quicksort is actually the most efficient algorithm to sort lists. Since it is a bit more complex conceptually than the first 3 and since the algorithms lesson is introduced quite early in the CS50x course, quicksort is skipped there. However, since you now have a lot of experience with Python, this algorithm will not be a problem for you!\n","\n","For this exercise, you will be implementing different sorting algorithms, quicksort included, and comparing their performance with different lists.\n","\n","You'll be working with an existing Python codebase that generates different types of lists (random, sorted, reverse sorted, nearly sorted) and the beginning of the code for comparing how different sorting algorithms perform. You can download the Python file with this codebase **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sBRtxciQASAQ0AjofF_mFx3gGm1eOiTr/view?usp=sharing)**. \n","\n","Your goal is to:\n","- Complete the three algorithm functions (you can create additional ones if you need them). First two should implement quicksort, but use a different pivot. The third algorithm can be anything that you choose – either one of the algorithms in the CS50 video or another one that you find. **You are strongly encouraged to try to write the algorithms yourself without looking at Python or other language implementations, except for pseudocode.**\n","- Expand the program to do a more detailed comparison of all the algorithms with different sets of lists.\n","- Try to make conclusions about the algorithm’s performance and how they relate to the lists being sorted. Discuss them in stand-ups and open sessions.\n","\n","You can read an explanation of quicksort [here](https://dev.to/robogeek95/a-visual-giude-on-quicksort-algorithm-55df). Feel free to look into alternatives though. As you may notice in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort), there’s quite a lot of room for optimisations! There is no need to go too deeply into it though – try to not spend more than the recommended hours on this exercise.\n","\n","Once you've completed the main task, feel free to extend it in ways that spark your curiosity. Here are a few suggestions:\n","\n","- Implement more sorting algorithms and add them to the comparison.\n","- Analyze how changing the size of the list affects the performance of the algorithms.\n","- Generate more types of lists to sort, such as lists with many duplicates or lists with a small range of values.\n","- Explore how to optimize your implementations for better performance.\n","- Compare your implementation with that of other learners. Remember though, you should compare the runtime of an algorithm on the same computer, so you will want to share your version of the algorithm or vice-versa. \n","\n","Implementing and analyzing sorting algorithms is a classic exercise in algorithmic thinking and computational complexity analysis. It's not just about learning how these algorithms work, but also about understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and why certain algorithms might be preferred in different situations. By comparing the performance of different algorithms on various types of lists, you can observe how the structure of input data can affect the efficiency of an algorithm. You will also get a much more practical understanding of how BigO analysis translates into real runtime performance.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Refactoring Your Code (2 hours)\n","Refactoring is the process of changing the code so that it works more efficiently and is more easy to read, yet has its functionality unchanged. It is a very common process when working with long-term projects. It is inevitable that some parts will be written hastily and suboptimally – whether it is inefficient, untidy, overly complex or verbose. \n","\n","Before moving to the final project of this module, look back at the projects and exercises that you have completed so far. First of all, it should be exciting to see how far you have progressed! It should also make you feel that you could improve parts of that code significantly now. Practice refactoring by improving some of this previous code of yours.\n","\n","Not only will this let you practice refactoring, but you may also find some patterns in your code that might make it particularly hard to maintain, understand and change in the future. By having to deal with it yourself, you will be much more mindful of it in the future when writing new code.\n","\n","\n","\n","# Direction for further research (1+ hours):\n","- How many instructions would your program need to do in order for it to become noticeably slow? E.g. how many iterations of a simple addition/subtraction would a loop need to have in order for the program to not finish within 10 seconds?\n","- Python has search algorithms integrated into the language. E.g. you can use `x in my_list`. Which algorithm is used for this search?\n","- How would you use binary search in Python for a sorted list? E.g. you have a sorted list of integers and you want to use binary search to check if an element exists in that list with binary search. When might you want to use binary search in Python?\n","- Why would somebody wish to use the programming language C these days?\n","- What other sorting algorithms can you find?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"j3PmtCjJcbYU"}}]}
