If you struggle, read the codeblock once to get a rough idea of what it should look like, close this window and try to continue writing the code / solution. Repeat this quick scan of the code block everytime you feel stuck until you manage to write code / solution that you feel you understand and which does what you want it to do based on the descriptions given. Check the suggested code block afterwards to confirm everything is correct and continue to the next section afterwards.\n","- *If you have managed to complete the task on your own:* read the text and whenever you encounter a code block, try to understand what it does by analysing it.

So you decide to change the code. This is something called refactoring – improving (hopefully) the way to code is written without changing the actual functionality of the code.

Inexprienced (or sometimes even experienced) engineers in such cases tend to estimate that their work is \"90% done\". However, in most cases, these first versions might actually be close to just 50% of the total work effort needed. While you might be writing less code after the initial version, the debbugging and testing that happens afterwards usually takes a lot of time. \n","\n","Be very careful with such estimations, as it is a very common reason for deadlines being missed. When working on a project, it is a very good practice to try to constantly estimate how much more time you think you will need to complete it and then revise whether your estimations were realistic. Accurate estimation of task completion time is a separate skill, often overlooked, that needs to be consciously developed but which is extremely valuable in a workplace."],"metadata":{"id":"kfV8v72cDgX6"}}]}
