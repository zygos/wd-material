By incorporating unit tests in your code, you can make it much easier to notice if some changes that you have made created some new issues. This can make your code much more reliable and the development process easier – instead of testing various scenarios manually one at a time each time you make some changes, you can simply use a single command to run all the tests that you have written previously.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","## [CS50P - Unit Tests](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/5/) (2 hours)\n","*Note: for any exercises in the future that you are asked to write unit tests, you can use pytest.*\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Problem set 5](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/5/) (3 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## HackerRank exercises (2 hours)\n","\n","- [Solve Me First](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/solve-me-first/problem?h_r=internal-search)\n","- [Birthday Cake Candles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem?h_r=internal-search)\n","- [Staircase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/staircase/problem?h_r=internal-search)\n","- [Mini-Max Sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem?h_r=internal-search)\n","- [Plus Minus](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/three-month-preparation-kit-plus-minus/problem?h_r=internal-search)\n","\n","For these links, make sure that you have created an account at HackerRank and logged in. You can register for the platform [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/auth/signup).\n","\n","Throughout your studies, you will encounter similar programming exercise platforms quite often. The goal is to help you get into the habit of regularly doing small programming challenges like these, long after the initial CS50P problem sets. Just as the CS50P problem sets, they are different from the larger-scale practical projects that you encounter at the end of the sprints. Such small exercises usually either have some very specific concepts that they are meant to teach or are meant to allow you to revise what you already know and get more confident at it. \n","\n","In some cases, especially in later exercises, you may need to do some research to understand the answer. It would be wrong to approach these challenges as if they are tests to evaluate your existing knowledge — expect to require some research. Not only is web search OK here (to explore concepts that could help you solve the problem, not searching for the exact solutions, of course), but it is actually encouraged if you don't figure out the answer quickly on your own. Just as with the larger projects, this approach will allow you to get better at effectively finding out new concepts in order to solve a problem. \n","\n","Last but not least, a reason for doing these exercises is because they can be quite fun! Some developers really enjoy the puzzle aspect of these challenges. If you find yourself doing the same, feel free to look for more similar platforms.  \n","\n","\n","**Notes & tips for using HackerRank:**\n","- In the solution window, choose Python 3 as the language.\n","- Using print statements and running the code regularly is a very good way to start and then to check your progress.\n","- Once you solve a problem, it's extremely useful to go through a couple of other solutions by other users and problem creators (\"Leaderboard\", \"Discussions\" and \"Editorial\" tabs). Try understanding at least one other way to solve the problem – this will make it easier and quicker to read code written by others and will also introduce you to new concepts. You will also start gaining an understanding of which solutions are good and which are not, even if all of them 'work'.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Direction for further research:\n","- What is Test Driven Development?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RIgE4-n-_6eI"}}]}
