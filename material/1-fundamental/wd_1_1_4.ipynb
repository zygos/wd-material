These parts allow you to attempt a task on your own first and then compare it with the provided solution. We strongly advise you to attempt the task before completing this part to see the answer.\n","\n","You should expect this (and the graded) task to be significantly more challenging than what you encountered in the CS50P problem sets so far. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, CS50P does not provide larger scale tasks, which require a different, yet vital skill – namely structuring the logic of a more complex program, even if the constituent parts are relatively simple. While it may be very challenging at first, practice will make solving subsequent complex problems much easier.\n","\n","The second, very important reason for increased complexity is to push our learners to study together and utilize the community aspect of Turing College. **A significant part of learners are not expected to be able to solve this task on their own at this point of their learning** – especially if they are new to programming. However, we put a lot of effort into forming learner batches that work well together – complete with learners that can help others and those who would benefit from this help. By asking for help, you are by no means showing weakness or a lack of skill. Instead, asking for help, while hard for most people at first, is one of the core learning steps that you will need to take to become successful at coding. Not only will it make your progress much faster, but it will also make it more fun as you start to interact more with other people that are on the same journey as you. It will also teach you a crucial piece of mindset that a junior developer is expected to have – a new developer is expected to struggle with things and they are expected to be able to ask for help once struggling on their own becomes inefficient. \n","\n","The plan for approaching this problem can be as follows: for the first hour or two, try to solve the problem on your own. Feel free to use the tools that you have learned about - web search, ChatGPT, StackOverflow, documentations. The only thing to avoid is trying to get the complete solutions – e.g. asking ChatGPT for a full implementation or looking for one online would not teach you that much (especially because it might contain some errors). However, you can definitely ask ChatGPT for feedback on your code or for information regarding how Python works.\n","\n","If after this initial hour or two you see that you are making little or no progress, you should turn to the community for help. Ask in the appropriate module channel (#module_1) if anyone would be interested in working together or helping you with module 1’s hands-on challenge. You can also join open sessions by JTLs to ask for help as well. In all these cases, it is good to try to have an idea on how you would describe what you are struggling with. E.g. don’t just say “I don’t know where to start” – instead, try to explain what you’ve attempted so far, why it didn’t work and whether you have any potential ideas of what you could try next. Maybe there’s some specific things that are preventing you from trying some of these ideas? E.g. maybe you can’t get a specific function to work or maybe you are getting some errors that you can’t figure out? Or maybe you can’t figure out how to add, even in pseudo-code, some specific task requirements?\n","\n","If you cannot complete the task within 10 hours of work even with the help of others, you should complete the part by doing its quiz and view the suggested solution. It will give you a lot of guidance and still allow you to challenge yourself. In such cases it is completely OK to spend at least 5 more hours working on understanding the suggested solution.\n","\n","## Academic Honesty\n","\n","When working with others, a common question is what may count as fair group-work and what may count as cheating. Generally, we try to follow the guidelines set here. For non-graded tasks, such as problem sets or hands-on tasks, the rules are more relaxed - you are free (and even encouraged) to work together with learners who are also currently working on the task. \n","\n","For graded tasks (i.e. projects requiring corrections), learners should never share complete solutions or parts of a working solution to learners who have not yet successfully passed the project (i.e. completed the corrections and received a passing grade). There are therefore two types of interactions when it comes to graded tasks: \n","- Learners who have completed the task can discuss it freely among themselves or with JTLs\n","- A learner who has not completed the task yet can get help and feedback **on their own code**. Anyone can help the learner by commenting on their code, asking useful questions and giving tips, but nobody can share pieces of code that could be a sizable part of the final solution (*‘sizable’ is mentioned in this case because it can still be fine to give small, generic pieces of code, such as an example how to use the random() function – use common sense*)\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Task Description\n","\n","For this task, you are asked to create a console based tic-tac-toe game in which the computer will play against you. The good news is that you will be able to win sometimes, as the computer will play randomly! You are provided with these requirements for the program:\n","\n","- The user always makes the first move\n","- The user should be asked to input their move until the game ends. The format for input should be “x, y” where x is the horizontal axis and y is the vertical axis. Upper left spot is 0, 0, lower right is 2, 2. (While it can seem weird at first, developers love indexing things from 0). You can assume that the user will always enter their input in the form “<digit>,<digit>” (i.e., no negative numbers, letters, symbols and multiple-digit numbers)\n","- After the user enters a move, the computer should make their move, if possible.\n","- Every time the computer makes its move, the state of the board should be printed out. The design does not need to be perfect – the important thing is that the state of the board should be clear.\n","- If either the player or the computer wins, the state of the board should be printed out and the winner announced. The program should exit at that point.\n","\n","*Additional challenge*: if you are more proficient at coding and find the task relatively easy (e.g. it took you less than four hours to complete), try to make the computer play optimally instead of randomly. Be sure to still read the suggested solution document, though!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Hints\n","When starting, try to write out the logic of the program with functions that are not implemented yet. This can help you split the problem into smaller pieces more easily. Then start implementing the functions one by one, testing them. Expect bugs to happen! Remember that you can use the debugging tools to figure out what the issues are. Also, if you see that you might need some additional functions that you have not yet seen (e.g. for making random choices for the computer), try to use the online tools that you have learned about.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Viewing the suggested solution\n","\n","Once you finish working on the task and are happy with the result, complete this part just as you would a normal one. Then, after completing the quiz, navigate back to this part and you will see a button “suggested solution” at the top. Click it and you will see a detailed explanation of how a programmer might approach a program like this. Even if you have completed the exercise on your own fully, it can be a very useful exercise to read through code written by others. The provided solution is deliberately written to show how the process of coding may look like - together with bugs and debugging them.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Estimate average time to complete: 10 hours**"],"metadata":{"id":"HYyLlmX3qUbk"}}]}
