Instead of focusing on individual work and comparing it to a given solution, we will start getting more experience with working in teams of developers. As you will see, this will encompass multiple different skills. \n","\n","The part will start with a video introducing Git and GitHub. While you have been using GitHub already for uploading your projects, chances are, you will be surprised by the full breadth of functionality that Git offers (and how complex it might get sometimes). Version Control is a crucial part of pretty much every software development team, so knowing how to use it will be extremely important in your career.\n","\n","After learning about GitHub, you will work on a more challenging task utilizing pair programming. In essence, pair programming means two people collaboratively working on the same coding problem at the same time. You will have likely already experienced something very similar in your STL correction if you were asked to make any changes to your code while sharing your screen. Similarly, in open sessions, JTLs often try to guide the learners when they are solving problems while sharing their screen. Besides being used in workplaces sometimes, pair programming has multiple learning benefits too:\n","Improving your capabilities of writing code under stress. Even in relaxed environments, writing code with someone watching and commenting can be stressful! \n","Improving your ability to explain your thought process while solving a coding problem\n","Improving your ability to quickly read and understand other people’s code\n","Seeing multiple ways to solve the same problem\n","\n","Notice that the first two points are especially important in technical job interviews.\n","\n","Finally, during this task, you will get a bit more freedom than previously – you will need to clearly define not only the assumptions that you make, but also some of the requirements for the program. Usually, non-developer team members such as Product Owners will be defining the overall goals of a task, but developers will then “refine” the tasks further to be able to agree clearly within their teams how the development should proceed. Sometimes, this will be limited to technical decisions only, other times – this can even lead to insights about how the whole program should work from the user-perspective. In this task, you will get an opportunity to practice planning and sharing the technical details and the overall design of the program.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Git and GitHub for Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw) (3 hours)\n","While watching this video, you might get the feeling that Git is such a powerful yet complex tool that it might need a separate short course to master fully. Do not be discouraged by that – the main goals for you right now should be as follows:\n","- To be able to confidently do the core actions of version control - creating a repository, staging changes, committing them, pushing them to a remote repository and pulling remote changes.\n","- To be comfortable with how branches work, how to create and switch between them.\n","- To be comfortable with performing very simple merges between branches.\n","- To get an initial understanding of what merge conflicts are, so that if you do encounter them, you could start to dig deeper and eventually solve them.\n","- Know what pull requests are\n","- To get a sense of what else is possible with Git so that if you need it, you could search for it and find the solution. E.g. you don’t need to remember how rebasing or amending works, but you should be aware that in case you do need to change the history of a repository, that there are ways how it can be done.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Git Basics Reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday) (0.5 hours)\n","## [Git Basics Reference (alternative)](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf\n",") (0.5 hours)\n","## [https://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index](Interactive Diagram for Git Commands (0.5 hours)\n","   - Note: you can click on separate columns\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Git Practice](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/exercise/master) (4 hours)\n","Complete exercises up until the exercise `commit-lost` (inclusive)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","After you’ve watched the “Git and GitHub for Beginners Tutorial” video, you may want to have a handy reference guide for quickly looking up the most commonly used commands. We recommend just skimming through it now to have an idea of what it contains and then using it later once you need to quickly remind yourself of some commands.\n","\n","In your upcoming projects, you are very strongly encouraged to start using version control regularly. E.g. stage, commit and push your changes often, write informative commit messages; If you want to try adding a feature to your code but are not sure if it will work or not, try creating a branch for it first and making the changes there, then merging the branch. A big benefit of this is not only that you will get more comfortable with git, but you might also avoid losing your files in case something unfortunate happens to your local files (e.g. the hard drive gets corrupted).\n","\n","Finally, by pushing commits to GitHub (even if it’s into private repositories), you will populate your personal account with activity which is publicly visible and which is very commonly checked by recruiters. If you start committing now when working on projects and have regular activity, it will help you significantly in the job search process later on. On the flipside, non-active Github repositories is a rather common way that companies immediately filter out entry-level candidates.  Keep in mind that this is something that you will not be able to “catch up” with quickly in case you skip it now – the earlier you start creating a history of activity, the better. \n","\n","<div><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/66k1gcS.png\"></div>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Direction for further research (1+ hours):\n","- What happens if you try to switch branches while you have changed unstaged files?\n","- Can you recover deleted git branches?\n","- What are some other popular software, such as GitHub, for managing Git repositories?\n","- What are some other popular tools for version control besides Git?\n","\n","# Peer programming exercise (10 hours)\n","\n","## Task description\n","\n","You are asked to implement a children’s card game called [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). The main technical requirement is that you use the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm that you have learned recently. Besides that, you are free to decide how exactly the program should work. E.g. you can choose if the user needs to make any inputs to make moves; you can choose what the output of the program should look like; you may even decide that you want to implement a variation of the game that’s described in the Wikipedia article. Your goal will be to write this program utilizing Git and remote [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).\n","\n","**Step 1**: Create a public GitHub repository with a README file. Clone it to your local machine. Every learner should have their own individual repository that they have created.\n","\n","**Step 2**: In the README file, write down the requirements for your program. You are free to choose the format of the requirements – try to think of what you, as a developer, would want to see in such a file if you were to receive it as your task. Stage, commit and push the changes to the online repository *before writing any code*. \n","\n","**Step 3**: Either in Discord, in a stand-up or an open session, ask if anyone else has started (or finished) working on this project and if they would be available for at least a 1-hour pair programming session. Arrange a time for such a session. You can also immediately arrange multiple times – either with the same person or different people. In total, you would ideally have at least 3 pair programming sessions for this task. Out of those 3 sessions, at least 1 should be working on your project and 1 working on somebody else’s project (again, remember that each learner has their own repository and their own implementation of the game). \n","\n","**Step 4:** Before the arranged pair programming session, if you will be working on your project in your repository, split the upcoming tasks that you think will need to be done in the pair programming session into small GitHub issues. The initial requirements that you have described in the README file may be very helpful here. For example, you may have written, as part of your requirements – “At the start of each game, a deck needs to be initialized in a random order. Once it’s initialized, it should be split evenly between two players”. This could be converted into two separate GitHub issues with these exact goals. \n","\n","**Step 5**: When the session starts, decide who will go first (you can use the `random` module :) ). You should both aim to spend about half of the time coding and half of the time observing. Note - during the whole session, you should be working on just one project (i.e. either your repository or your peer’s). \n","\n","The person writing code should assign the GitHub issue that they will be working on, share their screen and start working on the task. Note that if the first person writing code is the one working on someone else’s project, they will need to first clone the repository to their local machine. After half the time of the session is up, the person who was writing the code should commit and push their code to the repository so that the other person could continue where they left off. If the GitHub issue was completed, the issue should be closed as well.\n","\n","**Step 6:** The roles should be reversed now and the session continues. Remember to pull the newest changes from the remote repository before beginning to code on a new machine. At the end, once again, commit and push the changes. \n","\n","Bonus challenge – during the peer review exercise, try to deliberately cause a merge conflict, then solve it.\n","\n","**Step 7** Between the sessions, you are free to do some coding yourself. It is likely that the pair-programming session may have given you some new insights that you will want to try out. However, you should make sure that there’s still enough tasks to do during upcoming sessions if you haven’t yet done at least 3 of them. In case you finish too much of the tasks and there’s not enough for an upcoming session,  you can either update the requirements by adding more of them or aim to join other people’s projects for their pair programming sessions.\n","\n","**Steps 8**: Repeat steps 4-7 until you have completed at least 3 pair programming sessions. Once again, note that you can either have people join in to work on your project, or you can join others to work on theirs.\n","\n","**Step 9:** If there’s still some tasks remaining, complete the program.\n","\n","**Note: due to potentially needing to wait for the pair-programming sessions, you can work on this project in parallel to the main project. In extreme cases, you may even continue and complete this part after you have passed this sprint’s corrections.**\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RHSsFTIbAD32"}}]}
