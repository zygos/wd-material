You will have already encountered these briefly in the hands-on exercise most likely â€“ notably the random module. Understanding libraries and packages more deeply will expand the capabilities of your programs immensely! We will then continue to another concept that will open up even more capabilities to you - external APIs that you can interact with (with the help of libraries!).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","## [CS50P - Libraries](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/4/) (3 hours)\n","It is very important that you learn how to install packages. If you are struggling to get `pip install <package>` to work, joining open sessions by JTLs can be a really good way to get personalized help regarding this.\n","\n","You can test if everything works correctly by trying to install the `cowsay` package mentioned and trying to run it in your program.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Style](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/style/) (1 hour)\n","Do not spend too much time on this just yet. We are currently working with Python to learn the concepts universal to most programming languages, not just Python. So we are not that concerned with getting great at writing Python code that follows exact standards such as PEP8. However, it is still good to be aware of these guidelines in order to better reason about and build a personal sense of what is well-styled code.\n","\n","For the sake of practice, however, we advise you to go through some of your past code and try to format it according to some rules from PEP8 of your choice. Try to notice which changes seem the most meaningful and useful to you. Afterwards, use the black formatter to format it automatically and see what other changes it makes. You are also advised to use the black formatter in all the code submissions that you make in order to make it easier to read for the reviewers.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - problem set 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/4/) (3 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Direction for further research (1+ hours)\n","- What are some other common modules in Python that you might find useful? Choose 1 that you have not seen in the CS50P videos yet. They can be either in-built modules or not (i.e. modules you will need to install before being able to import them).\n","- Why are all modules not available immediately? E.g. why do you need to import the random module instead of it being available by default?\n","- How would you create a program that would use named arguments when it is entered? E.g. `python my_program.py --name Alice`\n","- How does pip work in more detail? E.g. where does the package get installed? \n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"S8Ddvy2a96qs"}}]}
