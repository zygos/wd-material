You can work in pretty much every single industry, you can work either alone or in teams, and you can choose to work remotely or in an office. The kind of web development that you do can be very different as well – you can focus on complex platforms used by millions of people, or smaller websites for local businesses, or anything in-between. Most web developers, however, specialize based on their interests and strengths:\n","- Front-end development that is responsible for code which creates beautiful interfaces and interactivity for the users;\n","- Back-end development which deals with storing, processing and providing the data to be displayed by the front-end;\n","Full-stack development that deals with both front-end and back-end. \n","\n","All of this allows for a great deal of flexibility and the ability to find a niche that aligns with your interests and skills.\n","\n","While the demand for experienced web developers is consistently high (even in periods of economic slowdown), the hardest part is almost always getting into the industry when you are just starting out. The many benefits of a web development career entices many people to try it, which means that the competition for junior developer positions is high as well.\n","\n","The goal of Turing College is to give motivated people like you an exceptional learning environment which would make them truly stand-out from the competition once they’ve finished our course. It is not meant to be easy, and it is not meant to be unrealistically quick (you won’t find us promising people that they can become web developers in just a couple of weeks!). Since you have passed our admissions, however, we are confident that you have what it takes to complete this course, become a web developer, and we are very honored to share this journey with you!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Structure of the course\n","\n","The smallest piece of Turing College material is called a Part, and multiple Parts make up a Sprint. Most Parts have a quiz at the end. The last Parts of each Sprint are different though — they require you to complete a practical project, submit it and schedule 1-1 project review session using our platform. Finally, the largest piece – a collection of sprints – is called a module and covers a large collection of related topics.\n","\n","In short: Module>Sprint>Part.\n","\n","Module 1 is called “​​Core programming & Computer Science” and will teach you just that. We will use the Python programming language, and we do not assume any prior programming knowledge. Even if you did do coding before, you will benefit from revising many of the topics here and likely find new ones that will be of great use. By the end of this module, you will feel much more confident in your coding skills which will allow you to continue to learn new programming languages and web-development specific technologies in modules 2 and beyond.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Resources used in this course\n","\n","CS50 is a series of courses taught in Harvard University which is also provided online. Turing College has been partnering with CS50 and our mentors have been teaching their courses for multiple years now. Like many others, we have found that it is a remarkable resource for learning the basics of programming and computer science, creating an incredibly strong base for multiple specializations of engineering – web development included. Therefore, many of the sprints at Turing College will have CS50 resources at their core.\n","\n","Besides CS50, this course will be using many other external resources. It is very important to note that **you should never need to pay for any of the learning material assigned**. If at any point it seems that you need to pay for access to a resource - please contact us either directly through Discord or using the support chat function in the platform.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Why are we using external content?\n","Like most bootcamps, schools, universities and other educational institutions, we make use of curated external content – such as books, videos, articles, interactive coding platforms and more. The reason for this is that for many topics, there are already great resources out there that have been created by top experts in the world. The difficulty in learning stems not from the lack of content but from finding the right content, which can be extremely difficult due to the sheer amount of various options (far from all of which are of good quality). It is also difficult to structure that content in such a way that you get a full, coherent path towards a successful career. Professional expert knowledge is needed for creating such a structure. Finally, for the vast majority of people, it is extremely beneficial to be in a group with peers and experts working through the same content. This allows you to get help when stuck and to strengthen your own knowledge by helping others.\n","\n","Turing College aims to provide top-level education by incorporating all of these things — carefully structured content by top professionals in the field together with a community of mentors and peers in which studying this content becomes fully efficient.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## What to do if you already know some topics or have previously gone through the given learning material?\n","We strongly suggest going through the material once more to ensure that you have a good understanding – you might notice that you’ve missed or forgotten something. Even if not, it can be a good refresher. You can also practice being curious (an immensely important trait for developers!) and try to look for more complicated questions inside these resources that you could then explore as part of the “direction for further research” (explained further).\n","\n","Finally, if you are experienced, be sure to try to help others as much as possible – whether it’s during stand-ups, via Discord or peer corrections. These are great ways to become a part of the learning community and to become qualified for a Junior Team Lead role if it interests you.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Managing time spent on each topic & resource\n","\n","When going through the resources given, unless noted otherwise, you should try to follow all the instructions in the resource and replicate the code given there. This will allow you to get a better hang of writing the code and to test whether you truly understand the topics. Furthermore, writing code regularly, even if it’s code that you see in a video, is a very useful way to practice writing with fewer errors. As you will quickly see, a single missing semicolon or an extra space can make your whole program break – everyone makes plenty of such mistakes at first (and even when they’re experienced!). Regular practice of writing code is something that will allow you to get better at making fewer of such mistakes.\n","\n","Next, for anyone to be truly successful in the field of web development, they need to be curious about it and to enjoy exploring it. The field is broad, developing rapidly and the ability to code provides so many opportunities, that there’s always new technologies, ideas and skills that you could be exploring. Because of this, we strongly encourage you to approach this course in the following way: when reading a resource, be aware of the questions that pop into your mind – write them down in a dedicated notepad (digital or not). Once you finish the resource, spend up to the same amount of time trying to answer those questions that you have written down (this will of course depend heavily on the exact resource). You will notice that some of these questions get answered in the resource itself, but some might not – in that case, search for more information yourself – whether it’s online searching, experimenting or discussing your ideas with other peer learners. This will allow you to build a personalized and unique set of knowledge! Finally, noting such questions down while learning will make it much easier to prepare for stand-ups at Turing College.\n","\n","The suggested time next to many resources will assume this kind of learning - active practice and experimentation with the tools or knowledge learned and also additional time spent exploring topics related to the main ones that you find yourself to be curious about.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Sprint 1 - First Steps Into Programming with Python\n","\n","In this sprint, you will learn to work with the Python programming language and the most common development tools. Just as importantly, besides technical skills, it will teach you the learning habits that will help you throughout the whole course and which will eventually make it much easier for you to land your first web development job. By the end of it, you will be ready for your first 1–1 project review with an expert!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\n","\n","## [Visual Studio Code for CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/visual_studio_code_for_cs50/) (1 hour)\n","\n","This is the tool that we suggest using for most of your coding when you start. You can use other tools as well if you are comfortable with it, but it can lead to potential difficulties with using the CS50 system in the problem sets.\n","\n","You will need to create a [GitHub](http://github.com/) account if you do not have one already. This same GitHub account will also be used for submitting your projects in the Turing College platform.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Functions, Variables](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/0/) (3 hours)\n","\n","We strongly suggest typing out the things shown in the video. If you find you already know these basics or have watched this video previously, you can either choose to watch the video at a higher speed or if you are extremely confident - skip it.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - problem set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/)  (2 hours)\n","\n","Some steps need to be done differently in order to work with the Turing College CS50 environment:\n","  - Step 1: skip this step\n","  - Step 2: submit this form instead: https://submit.cs50.io/invites/82f6b05c113d414691ec567ef7a9a679 (authenticate your GitHub account that you will be using for Turing College)\n","  - All other steps should be followed as they are written\n","\n","Solve the 5 exercises, confirm them using check50 and submit them using submit50. \n","\n","Note that Turing College staff will be able to see these submissions. While we will not be checking all of them, we might do so in case we see that there are some particular gaps of knowledge in order to discuss and help you with the relevant exercises.\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Importance of fast typing and general computer use proficiency (1 hour)\n","\n","As a developer, you will be typing a lot and you want to make sure that you can do that efficiently! Learning to type fast, besides being extremely useful in multiple ways, can also be used as a break between the more mentally demanding parts of the course. It can be a fun way to vary your learning routine and to do something that will lead to really easily measurable progress. \n","\n","Our recommendation would be to practice for ~20 minutes daily until you can reach at least 60 words per minute (wpm) at https://www.livechat.com/typing-speed-test/#/ consistently. For practicing, there are multiple resources online, such as https://www.typingstudy.com/ , https://monkeytype.com/ , https://www.typing.com/student and others – you can choose the one that you prefer and which suits your level best. \n","\n","\n","Why is this important? First of all, efficiency – you want to practice to do things quickly, as it can directly affect how much value you can create as a developer in a set amount of time. This does not apply to all the situations though – when doing complex coding, you are likely to spend 90% or more of the time thinking and only the rest actually typing. But there is also going to be a lot of times when you are doing routine tasks that you know exactly how to do and you simply need to do it fast. \n","\n","Furthermore, there's another important reason to practice and focus on this - other programmers are likely to guess your skill level (whether consciously or unconsciously) based on how you use the computer. This is relevant both during interviews in case you are asked to do some live coding and also when you start working. E.g., if someone sees you type fast, not look at the keyboard, use shortcuts efficiently and quickly, they will almost always automatically judge you as more competent. On the other hand, if you demonstrate inefficient and inexperienced use, e.g. typing very slowly looking at your keyboard, only then looking at the monitor to check if you’ve made any mistakes, using your mouse to copy and paste things instead of using ctrl-c + ctrl+v (or cmd-c + cmd-v), you will likely create an image of someone who will not be a proficient developer.\n","\n","\n","A side note on things that can improve or damage your image as a developer - a non-obvious and sometimes unconscious thing that makes you appear proficient or not is your use of English. English is almost inevitable when you are a developer, because all the documentation for the tools you will use are going to be in this language. Turing College therefore uses English  whenever possible. You are expected to talk in English during standups, during code reviews, on Discord – even if everyone speaks the same native language other than English. Such regular English practice throughout the whole course will make you much more comfortable and better with the language.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Revision of core Turing College concepts  (30 minutes)\n","\n","In case you haven’t before, be sure to read the following documents about the core aspects of Turing College. The first quizzes may even contain questions that will test your understanding of these topics.\n","\n","- [Stand-ups](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/760774730/Stand-up+meetings)\n","- [Deadlines](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/584286209/Deadlines)\n","- [Communication channels](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537396422/Communication+channels)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Direction for further research (1+ hours) \n","\n","Some parts will have sections called “Direction for further research” which will provide prompts for further, optional and more personalized learning experiences based on a learner’s individual interests and goals. A learner can choose to explore the directions suggested by us, or they can look for some other topics on their own. Either way, we advise every learner to look for additional topics that they are curious about often and dedicate at least an hour or two in each Part for these explorations. This way, you will have the opportunity to develop your own unique strengths and also have time for being curious. \n","\n","The exact time you spend on these questions depends on your availability – try to plan your schedule in such a way that you can meet the deadlines set in the Turing Platform. Ìf a direction is time consuming, you can choose to research it during multiple parts as well (for example, the suggestion to try installing Linux is likely to require quite a bit of time, especially because once you install it, you will likely want to play around with it!).\n","\n","When exploring these in these directions, try to be mindful whether it is something that is likely to be crucial for your learning or if it is just something that is “nice to know”. It can be very hard to determine the importance of such topics on your own quickly sometimes – open sessions and stand-ups are therefore great opportunities to discuss these things with others! However, identification of the importance of topics is crucial when aiming to become a self-directed learner.\n","\n","\n","- Easy: In the functions example, would the code work if the main() function was defined after the hello() function? Why?\n","- Try to run a Python program on your machine without the online VSCode IDE.\n","- What is the difference between CLI, console, terminal and shell? Or are these synonyms? Is the distinction, if there is any, actually relevant in most conversations and for practical use?\n","- Advanced: Installing Linux if you haven't done that before. Recommended if you are using Windows and have some experience with programming and find this sprint to be very easy for you. We recommend Ubuntu for starting: https://ubuntu.com/desktop. With a Mac, the installation is much more complicated and you don't get as much benefit, since the command line in MacOS is very similar to Linux. A slightly easier version of this (but still recommended for advanced learners only) is trying out the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) – an easier and quicker way to get access to a Linux system if you are using Windows (which is actually extremely powerful and can be used by experienced developers).\n","\n","\n","## Your first quiz\n","\n","Once you have gone through the material, it’s time for the first quiz! \n","\n","Note that while some questions might have a direct answer to them in the resources you’ve read, some will not (especially in later sprints). Use these questions as an indication of whether you are raising the right questions yourself and whether you are exploring them deeply enough. \n","\n","If you don’t answer some of the questions correctly, do not worry – these quizzes are for self reflection only and will not impact your progress at Turing College in any way. Simply use them as a potential indicator for the topics that you can study further if you want to. If you disagree with an answer, first discuss it with your peers, JTLs or STLs and if you still think there’s an error in the answer, we would greatly appreciate it if you could message us via the support chat and let us know.\n","\n","Good luck!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vSB4zvtlIo93"}}]}
