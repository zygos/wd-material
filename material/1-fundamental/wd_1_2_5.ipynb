Just as in the hands-on exercise, the challenge in this task is going to be figuring out how to use specific libraries and APIs instead of writing complex logic. Furthermore, instead of a single STL correction, you will need to receive 2 peer corrections to pass this sprint. It also means that you will be able to start performing corrections to other learners yourself! \n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Project description\n","\n","In this practical exercise, you will develop a Python program that will be able to fetch information from two different APIs and send the retrieved information as an email message.\n","\n","## The requirements you are given to implement are as follows:\n","- The program should be run with two command line arguments - an email address and an API to use (one out of two that you have implemented)\n","- Your program should first check if the format of the command line arguments is valid\n","  - The email provided should be checked. It can be as complex as you choose to be – the most simple implementation would simply check whether an “@” and a “.” exist.\n","  - The program should check whether the API argument passed is one of the two that you have implemented\n","- Your program should then call the API chosen. E.g. the current weather in your town/current moon phase in your town/a currency exchange rate of your choice, or anything else that you choose.\n","- The information received from an API should be formatted into a human-readable message and sent to the email which was provided in the command line argument. You should use a Gmail account for sending the email.\n","  -  **You should only use Python’s in-built libraries to send the email via a Gmail account**, i.e. you should not install any additional tools or libraries. We also recommend creating a new Gmail account meant specifically for this exercise instead of using your personal one - that way you will avoid any potential security issues.\n","- Your program should use the try/except statements at least once. \n","- Your program should have at least 3 unit tests.\n","- At the end of the file, as a comment, add the 5 keybinds you researched in Part 1 of this sprint\n","\n","The APIs chosen should be different from the ones shown in the CS50P videos. A possible place to explore free APIs is https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis \n","\n","Just as before, you should list any assumptions that you make about the requirements if they are not explicitly stated here.\n","\n","You should expect to find multiple suggestions on how to send an email using Python and Gmail – some of them might look extremely complex, others might no longer work. Some of Google’s own guides might be out of date while some websites might even make the suggestions deliberately complex in order to advertise their own tools! Try not to worry though and continue tinkering with various solutions – you are expected to need to try multiple ones until you reach a solution that works. This is what real developers would usually need to do as well! Finally, you may also be required to do some additional steps than simply writing code (remember how you needed to generate an API key for using the openAI’s challenge). \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Reviewer role\n","\n","Different projects may require you to structure your presentation in different ways based on the imagined role of the reviewer. The goal is to practice interacting with different stakeholders that a developer will likely encounter in their careers.\n","\n","In this project, imagine that you are introducing your project to a colleague developer of similar seniority, asking for their feedback. They have technical expertise and will try to understand the work that you have done, although they might not always be fully objective – they will instead be doing their best to give you feedback and ideas on how to make potential improvements. Similarly to presentations to a senior developer, you want to demonstrate both that the program works and to explain what the thought process was in the code and writing it.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Project evaluation criteria\n","\n","- The program is able to accept two command line arguments\n","- The program checks whether command line arguments are valid\n","- The program is able to call two different APIs\n","- The program is able to create a message based on the information retrieved from the APIs\n","- The program is able to send an email via a Gmail account\n","- At least three unit tests are written\n","- At least one try/except block is used\n","- Organization and style of the code. The code should be easy to read, with well-named functions, variables, and comments.\n","- General understanding of sprint topics\n","- 5 keybinds listed at the end of the submission file\n","\n","During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.\n","\n","**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask (a reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more, however!)**\n","\n","\n","- What is an API?\n","- What are some possible ways to call an API using Python?\n","- Why do we need unit tests?\n","- What are some criteria for good unit tests?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Submission \n","\n","To submit the project and allow the reviewer to view your work beforehand, go to your GitHub repository by clicking on the GitHub icon above. Next, select \"Add File\"->\"Upload Files\". Choose the files you worked on to upload them, then click the green \"Commit changes\" button.\n","\n","Note: **the repository for this project is different from the one you used in the last project!** Make sure you are using the correct one by clicking on the GitHub icon in this project’s page.\n","\n","Once you have completed all the steps of the project and uploaded your work, go to the Turing Platform and click the \"Submit Project\" button to complete it. The platform then allows you to see the times when reviewers are available to have a call with you and review the project. Simply book a time that suits you. If there are no times available, feel free to write a message in the #wd_correction_scheduling channel on Discord. For this project, other peer learners who have submitted or completed this project will need to add their availability.\n","\n","When booking a peer correction, you might get an STL if there are no learners available. However, the same STL can never perform both corrections for the same learner for the same sprint. **You do not have to worry about who (i.e. which role) gets assigned for your reviews – the platform handles this automatically.**\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Performing Peer Corrections\n","\n","\n","*Once you have submitted your solution, add your availability to the platform so that others can book a correction with you*. To do this, you should click on the \"My Availability\" button in the top left corner of the Turing platform. By performing corrections, you will receive correction points which you will need to receive further peer corrections yourself.\n","\n","Once someone books a correction with you, you will get a notification in your email and via Discord. Remember to check the uploaded work of the other learner before the correction. This will allow you to prepare and give better feedback.\n","\n","Not all sprints allow you to perform corrections as soon as you submit them (before successfully passing the corrections yourself). For further sprints, unless stated otherwise, you should assume that you will only be able to perform corrections once you pass them successfully yourself.\n","\n","Peer corrections, first and foremost, are meant to be a learning experience for both you and the learner you are reviewing. Evaluation is the secondary goal and we do not expect learners to be highly objective in their scores. Use peer corrections as an opportunity to not practice reading the code of others and seeing different ways of solving the problems you have worked on, but also to practice your soft skills as well.\n","\n","Read an in-depth guide about corrections here: https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537395951/Peer+expert+reviews+corrections\n","\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Estimate average time to complete: 15 hours**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JCMILGYdCbxi"}}]}
