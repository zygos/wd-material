There are only a couple of more topics to go before you can confidently say that you know the full extent of programming basics with Python. This sprint will cover most of these topics. \n","\n","First, you will learn about working with files. This will allow you to write much more powerful code, as it will be capable of storing and sharing information between multiple runs of the program. It will also be an indirect introduction to working with databases that are a core part of web development.\n","\n","Part 2 will cover a topic that is by far the most wide-ranging so far - Object-Oriented Programming. It will allow you to take a completely different approach to thinking about the code you write. It is the most widely used programming paradigm right now that is present in almost all the most popular programming languages - Python, Javascript, Java, Python, C++, and many more. This sprint will serve as a short introduction to it – you will have the whole course to master it though.\n","\n","Part 3 will focus on collaborative programming work. This time, instead of a hands-on exercise, you will first learn about the capabilities of Git and GitHub. Then you will work on a project together with your peers utilizing the pair-programming approach. This will also serve as an opportunity to start practicing Object-Oriented programming more deeply.\n","\n","For the 4th and final part, you will work on a project that will require you to combine all that you have learned so far. You will build a learning tool that will adapt to you based on what you know!\n","\n","Expect parts 3 and 4 to be reasonably more complex than previous parts – that is the reason for only having 4 parts instead of 5 in this sprint.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P – File I/O](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/6/) (4 hours)\n","\n","\n","## [CS50P – Problem Set 6](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/6/) (4 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Direction for further research (1+ hours):\n","- What are some other parameters that can be used with the `open()` function?\n","- Why is it possible to iterate over a variable to which an opened file is assigned? Is it a list?\n","- How would you change one line in a file without overwriting the whole file?\n","- Reminder – are you practicing touch-typing regularly? What is the highest wpm that you can reach right now?\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KmrsT4rv4cSz"}}]}
