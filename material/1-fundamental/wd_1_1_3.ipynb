Once you know these, you will have quite a lot of capabilities already to write rather powerful programs!\n","\n","With more complicated programming comes more complicated problems as well though! We will continue learning about how to identify and solve the issues that arise. We will look into some of the most common (and also modern) ways how developers find help online.\n","\n","<br> \n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\n","\n","<br> \n","\n","## [CS50P - Loops](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/2/) (3 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Getting help online (1 hour)\n","\n","**Stackoverflow**\n","\n","This is the most common website for asking programming related questions. Whenever you search for a question online, it is likely that you will find a Stack Overflow page on it. Unless your question is extremely specific and rare (this is extremely unlikely when you are just starting to learn the basics of coding), there is going to be a question about it already – so you do not actually need to be asking questions yourself most of the time – you just need to find a thread about the same question that someone else has asked and answered already. \n","\n","You should be mindful about several things when checking the answers, however – not only whether the answer is the top rated one. It is always a good idea to check the comments below the answers – quite often, there might be some nuances that are worth noting. Furthermore, check the date of the answer – sometimes an older answer will be the most upvoted one, even though there could be a more recent, better solution with with newer versions of the programming language/tool in question.\n","\n","You should not be afraid to copy the code you find on Stack Overflow – however, you should always try to understand how it works, if possible.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**ChatGPT, Bing and other AI assistants**\n","\n","Chat bots like ChatGPT or Bing Chat are surprisingly good at helping with programming questions. Not only can they explain a concept that you ask about but they can also write code that you ask for or even debug your own code. These capabilities can make learning and work significantly easier and faster – we definitely recommend trying to incorporate these into your toolset. To do it effectively though, you need to be very aware of the strengths and weaknesses.\n","\n","The biggest issue with AI Chat tools right now is that they still give wrong answers with extreme confidence quite often. Because of this, it is crucial that whenever you do get help from these tools, you double-check the correctness of the answers. For example – if you get a piece of code – test it with various inputs to see if it really does what it says it does. If it explains how a particular function works – try it out to confirm it yourself. If it gives you a conceptual answer – try to find a reliable source of information online to confirm it (e.g. a documentation or a reliable, up-to-date video explaining the concept).\n","\n","Besides chat bots, there are also tools meant specifically for AI-assisted coding, such as GitHub Copilot. We will cover these later, since for now, while learning, it is better to write as much code on your own as possible – that way once you do use more advanced AI tools, you will be able to do it much more efficiently.\n","\n","*Note: at the time of writing, Bing Chat is only available if you opt-in for early access and get an invite. We strongly recommend you try to get this invite, as the search function it provides can be extremely useful – it can give links to the sources of information it uses, which makes it much easier to check for accuracy (which is still needed, as it can give answers that are wrong or even contrary to what is said in the linked pages!).*\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Documentations**\n","\n","While not always the most user-friendly source of information, especially when you are just starting out as a developer, documentations are an indispensable part of how to get reliable information about how a programming language, a library or a piece of software works. It is a good idea to start practicing reading documentations early. Our recommendation is that every once in a while, when you learn a new function or when you’re searching for one, you should try to read the documentation for it. The example with print() function in the previous CS50P video is a good one – you can do the same for all the functions in Python if you wanted to.\n","\n","A thing to keep in mind is that while documentations for popular programming languages like Python are extremely well written and are almost always up-to-date, once you get to less widely used tools, their documentations can be much less accurate. As an extreme example, the new and quickly developing web3 space has languages where the documentation can be inaccurate almost as often as it is accurate!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Youtube videos**\n","\n","If you have more time and want a more easy-to-follow way to learn something, you can always search for a specific concept explanation on Youtube. Once again – be sure to check whether the video is recent enough to make sure that you are not viewing something that is only applicable for older versions. For example, while Python 3 is the default version of the language, Python 2 was still used very widely just a couple of years ago – because of this, you might still find videos that will appear to use a slightly different syntax (one of the most common ways how you can notice an old version of Python is using the print function without any brackets). \n","\n","\n","Try to regularly and consciously switch between using all of these tools. During learning, it might be tempting to use only one tool if it works for you, but it is certainly better if you get comfortable with all of them – that way a much wider range of information will become available to you. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [Debugging continued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbKxB7g4e68&t) (1 hour)\n","In this example, you will notice something you haven’t seen before – usage of enumerate() on a list. While the problem in the video can be solved already by the techniques you know from CS50P videos, use this as an opportunity to try to learn about a new concept on your own. It’s a perfect opportunity to try using the online help tools you just learned about.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Problem set 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2) (3 hours)\n","\n","Note that at this point, the questions might start to become a bit more challenging – it might not always be enough to simply remember everything shown in the accompanying video. What you should do, however, is start to try to explore the functionality of Python more deeply. You should start making guesses about what features there might be in the language, searching for them online and testing them out if you find them. As an example, when you start working on the first problem, you might first think to check whether a character is capitalized by comparing it to every single uppercase character that you write. However, as a developer, whenever you find yourself writing something tedious which repeats a lot, you should start asking yourself – maybe there’s a better way to do this? For example, maybe there is an existing function that you could use to test if a character is uppercase or not? With a question like this, you could then use the knowledge learned about getting help online to quickly test your assumptions.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Direction for further research (1+ hours)\n","- Are the limits to what values a dictionary can contain? What about keys? Can a dictionary contain dictionaries?\n","- What does “Stack Overflow” actually mean?\n","- Try to find problems or questions that ChatGPT will answer incorrectly.\n","- Try to glance over the documentation of in-built functions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html. Maybe you can find some functions that are relatively easy to understand and useful? \n","- What are the main differences between Python 2 and Python 3?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Reminder\n","Spend some time daily to practice touch typing if you cannot reach 60 wpm consistently yet. Also, if you notice that you are clicking some buttons often – check if there might be a keybind for it. Developers sometimes like to challenge themselves to use the mouse as little as possible (or not at all) – while this can be more of a vanity thing most of the time, it is still interesting to try sometimes and a useful way to make your workflow more efficient.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KDVlsPnfo6dP"}}]}
