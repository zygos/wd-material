We are not stopping here, however, as there are still many additional concepts to learn. \n","\n","In this sprint, we will learn about exceptions, libraries, external API’s and basics of unit testing. Similarly to functions, variables, conditionals and loops, these concepts are used extensively in nearly all of programming. While understanding exceptions and testing will make you capable of writing more robust code which is capable of elegantly dealing with potential issues, the use of libraries and APIs will make an incredibly wider array of features available to you. For now though, let’s start with exceptions…\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","## [CS50P - Exceptions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/3/) (2 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [A quick summary of exceptions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp) (0.5 hours)\n","Besides a summary of the syntax shown in CS50P videos, you will see an additional `finally` statement and an example of how to raise your own exceptions.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","[CS50P - problem set 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/) (3 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Keybinds (1 hour)\n","\n","During this sprint, try to find 5 keybinds or shortcuts in your IDE that are useful to you when coding. Try to use them regularly to make it a habit. During the correction at the end of this sprint, you will be asked to share the 5 keybinds/shortcuts with the reviewers (and since you will be performing reviews as well, someone else will share theirs with you too!). At least 3 of the keybinds should not be trivial, e.g. ctrl+c, ctrl+v, ctrl+f would not count, but ctrl (cmd) + left-click on a function to go to the definition of the function is perfect.\n","\n","One way to find the available keybinds is by clicking the cogwheel icon in the bottom-left of the VS Code screen and clicking on keyboard shortcuts (there’s even a shortcut for accessing this list as well!). You will see a huge list of keybinds here though, so you might want to approach it a bit differently at first – maybe searching the web for “most useful keybinds for VS code” first.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Direction for further research (1+ hours)\n","- How many different built-in errors does Python have? Where might you be able to check them?\n","- The “outdated” problem mentions that computers usually format the date as “YYYY-MM-DD”. Is that the format that computers usually store dates internally though?\n","- What was the “Year 2000 problem”?\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7QP7Ins38dte"}}]}
