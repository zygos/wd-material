It is extremely widely used today and has a lot of benefits when it comes to writing larger, more complex programs. In essence, it will allow you to start thinking about programs in a more intuitive way, because it models real-world concepts and systems more naturally. By representing real-world entities as objects and their interactions as methods, programmers can design software that is easier to understand and modify. Moreover, OOP's emphasis on encapsulation ensures that each object keeps its state private and exposes only what is necessary to the outside world. This principle not only enhances code security but also simplifies debugging, as changes in one part of the system are less likely to create unintended consequences elsewhere.\n","\n","Learning OOP is undoubtedly worth the investment, as it equips you with the skills necessary to tackle complex projects with ease. By mastering OOP concepts, you'll be able to create more efficient, scalable, and flexible software that can adapt to changing requirements. CS50 will help you explore the foundational principles of OOP first. The remaining two parts of this sprint will then give you opportunities to practice these concepts further in more large-scale projects. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\t\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Object-Oriented Programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/8/) (4 hours)\n","\n","If you research more into OOP, you may find a description of the four core concepts of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. What this implies is that there is quite a lot to OOP that is not yet covered in this CS50 lecture. This is fine, however, as for now, we want to get comfortable with a more simple use of OOP (which in itself is a lot if you’re just starting out!). In future sprints and modules, you will use OOP a lot more and even encounter other languages that use it – we will dig even deeper into OOP then.\n","\n","For complex and large topics like OOP, you might find that it is a good strategy to explore it consistently over a longer period of time instead of trying to learn everything all at once. I.e. instead of going down the rabbit hole of OOP readings and videos right now, you might want to get the core understanding that would then allow you to continue learning new concepts as you encounter them later on.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","##  [Tips For Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ghD-XjjO2g) (0.5 hours)\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","##  [Composition vs Inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcP8ZpUR38) (1 hour)\n","\n","Remember that if you see concepts that you are not familiar with, e.g. a “@dataclass” decorator or an “ABC” class, you should be able to use the tools you know to find out more about them. E.g. you could ask ChatGPT questions like these to get detailed explanation and examples that you could run yourself and try out:\n","- What does @dataclass do python\n","- What is the ABC class in Python?\n","- Would I not be able to instantiate the MyConcreteClass if the abstract method was not defined in the MyConcreteClass?\n","- Can you use @dataclass for an abstract class?\n","- If a class inherits ABC but does not have any abstract methods, would it still be impossible to instantiate it?\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Problem set 8](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/8/) (5 hours)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Direction for further research (1+ hours):\n","- What are the pros and cons of different programming paradigms? In which cases/industries are specific paradigms used more than others?\n","- Assume you want to programmatically get all the parameters of any object - how would you do that without creating a new method for it?\n","- Is it possible to extract the exact code of a method inside a class? E.g. could you write a program that takes a class, a name of the function and then prints out the code which was made to define that method? What if it’s an in-built class and method, such as `list` and `__init__` for `list`?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"E5k31cuY-g-p"}}]}
