Instead of focusing on more complex logic, you will be figuring out how to implement a slightly more complex library. You will likely be surprised at how powerful the programs you write can already be, once you start using external packages!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Task description\n","\n","Are you annoyed that ChatGPT works slowly sometimes? Or that it is sometimes non-reachable completely? It turns out, you already know enough concepts to build a program that interacts with OpenAI’s Chat API and to avoid all of those issues! Your task will be to create a program that will allow you to chat with ChatGPT via your terminal using OpenAI’s Chat Completion API.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## The exact task requirements are as follows:\n","\n","- Your program should accept two arguments when it is run: an API key and a name for the ChatBot. E.g. you should run it using:\n","`python gptbot <API_key> Bobby` \n","For a slight challenge, you can also use a system variable to securely pass in the API key, even though you have not learned about these yet.\n","You should get into the habit of never adding sensitive information directly into your main code files. It is surprising how often developers accidentally cause major security breaches by simply having sensitive information, like passwords or API keys in the files that they upload publicly, e.g. into Git repositories.\n","- The program, when started, should prompt the user for the first message. \n","- When user presses Enter, the program should get a response from GPT and print out the response message, starting it with `AI: `\n","- The user should then be able to continue the conversation (instead of starting it all over again with each input). This means you will be sending an ever longer message history to the API.\n","- The ChatBot should identify itself with the name you provided\n","- The program should end when you press ctrl+d (cmd+d on Mac) by printing out “Bye!”  and the total amount of tokens used in the conversation. \n","- The program should also end if the conversation becomes too long for the API.\n","- Your program should use the `openai` package and the Chat Completion API. The engine to use is “gpt-3.5-turbo” or a more recent one if it is available.\n","- Your program should use at least one try/except statement\n","- Your program should have at least one unit test that can be run using `pytest test`. If you find that writing multiple tests for your functions is particularly tricky, try asking ChatGPT to write the unit tests for your code then double check if they are working properly. AI assistants are actually a very good tool for creating unit tests (a task that quite a lot of developers find a bit tedious).\n","\n","\n","**Note:** OpenAI provides free credits when you first start using the API. The free credits should be plenty for this exercise. If, on the other hand, you have used the credits before, you can try to simply create a new account. If OpenAI does not provide you with any free credits, please contact Turing College support via the platform chat.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","**Hint:**\n","\n","*(If you feel confident, try to solve the task without looking at the following)*\n","\n","You will need to accomplish the following steps:\n","- Find the documentation for OpenAI's Chat Completion API, which most likely includes some examples of sending simple API requests with Python.\n","- Make sure you have an OpenAI account\n","- Get an API key for a personal account\n","- Make your program accept the API key as a command line argument\n","- (optional) make the API key accessible via a system variable\n","- Install the required library via the terminal\n","- Test that you can send the most basic request and receive a response (note: even though you have learned to use the requests module, it is not always required to use it to make requests!)\n","- Enable continuation of the conversation\n","- Make the AI respond to the name that is passed as an argument.\n","- Keep a count how many tokens have been used\n","- Write a couple of unit tests, ensuring that they are simple. If it seems it’s impossible to do so – maybe you need to split your functions a bit, so that you have more simple ones that you can test.\n","- Handle exiting of the program\n","- Double check that you have used at least one try/except statement\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Bonus challenge\n","Create a program that makes chatGPT talk to itself. It should have two different personalities, one called Alice, one called Bob. Both of them should have a different temperature setting. \n","\n","The user should click “enter” without any input if they would like the next conversation step to happen.\n","\n","The user should also be able to type “topic: <description of a topic>”. This should cause the AI in its next message to try to switch the topic to what the user has described. It is possible that this will not work fully reliably, but if you are curious about GPT, you can try to experiment how to make it happen more consistently.\n","\n","If the user enters anything other than “topic: <description>” format, they should be informed that this is invalid input and asked to either enter it correctly or not enter any input at all.\n","\n","<br> \n","\n","## Approach to solving the task\n","\n","You are once again advised to take a similar approach as in the previous hands-on exercise:\n","- 1-2 hours of attempting to solve the task on your own\n","- If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you – we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs. Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else – whether it is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you or JTLs in open sessions.\n","- If you still can’t solve it, check the suggested solution and spend as much time as needed (also based on what you have available until the next deadline) to understand it.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7Qf41j2qBksa"}}]}
