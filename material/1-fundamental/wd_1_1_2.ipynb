You can already be proud of the fact that you have started writing your own code in Python. Next, we will continue learning more about how some of the core concepts in programming work – conditional statements.\n","\n","We will also delve a bit deeper into debugging your code. Almost certainly, by now you will have written some code that will have resulted in some errors. It is very important to try to understand those errors and have the tools to find them.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","# Key learning topics & resources for this part\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Conditionals](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/1/) (2 hours)\n","\n","Remember to write the code you see yourself. Also, try to do some experimenting. For example, when watching the part about if and elif, you might ask yourself a question – can you have if statements within if statements? Try it out!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Debugging (2 hours)\n","[Debugging Python in VSCode - 01 - Intro to Debugging in VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEdq7gC_RTA)\n","\n","[Debugging Python in VSCode - 02 - Step Over Line of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypxabWbxSBY)\n","\n","[Debugging Python in VSCode - 03 - Step Into and Step Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4hHQyUZffI)\n","\n","\n","Besides giving some great tips on how to debug your code, we would also like to use this video as an illustration and exercise for another thing that you are likely to encounter very often both when learning and when working as a web developer. The instructions and guides that you see might often have some small (or sometimes not small at all!) discrepancies compared to what you see on your own computer. You will inevitably need to learn how to deal with such situations, as frustrating as they might be. With time you will get an intuitive understanding regarding what parts you can freely tinker with in order to get the results you need. \n","\n","The words “tinkering” or “experimenting” are particularly fitting here – a developer will often simply try different things that might potentially work without being fully sure of what will happen, look at what the results are and move towards a solution this way. And yes, in some cases, you might break things this way – but it is expected and you should not be too afraid of it (although evaluating the risk of what you can break is another useful skill that you will get good at)! If you do break something – it just means that you will need to find a way to fix it – a new challenge, but something that will likely lead to additional useful insights and learning as well! An important thing separating a novice developer from a senior one is often not the amount of general knowledge about how “things should be done right” - it is actually the experience and the capability to identify why things go wrong and how to solve that!\n","\n","In this particular video you might notice that once the button with play and bug icon is pressed on the left, there are immediately tabs called “Variables”, “Watch”, “Call stack”. However, if you click the same button in your online version of VS Code, something else might appear and the tabs will not be there (although such things can change quickly - it could be possible that when you are reading this, everything will work exactly as in the video! Do let Turing College know if that’s the case :) ). Your exercise in this case is to tinker with VS Code to try and find out how to reach the same kind of tab on the left as you see in the video and how to then perform the debugging just as in the video (you should be able to write and understand a program identical to what is being shown). \n","\n","Try to do this as soon as you reach this part of the video. If you get truly stuck (this can actually be a very hard exercise, especially depending on how your environment will work) – try to use the open sessions, stand-ups and Discord to get help and move on to the CS50P Problem set in the meantime. \n","\n","*Some hints:*\n","- Try to notice all the errors that are being shown; \n","- Google the errors if you are not sure what they mean (if the error is large, you might want to google only the part which you think is the most relevant);\n","- Depending on the error that you get, you might even need to use some of the knowledge you gained in the previous part regarding command line, specifically determining the location of files.\n","- .json is a common file format used for controlling the settings of a program. You might want to try to understand if the debugging part is controlled by a .json file and if some changes could be needed there. The errors might give a hint regarding what needs to be changed.\n","- You might find a different way to solve the issue without using the hints above.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## [CS50P - Problem set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/) (3 hours)\n","Solve and submit all 5 problems. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Core TC concepts (1 hour)\n","[Junior Team Leads](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537396988/Junior+Team+Leads+JTLs)\n","\n","[Senior Team Leads](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537396935/Senior+Team+Leads+STLs)\n","\n","[Self paced Learning](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/551682215/Self-paced+learning)\n","\n","[Open sessions](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/762970113/Open+Sessions)\n","\n","[TC Vocabulary](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537396546/Vocabulary)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","## Reminder\n","Remember to dedicate time to regularly practicing fast (touch) typing!\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mDmuPj8enHYN"}}]}
