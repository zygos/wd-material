# Interactive guide: SQL Island (1 hour)

- Resource: [SQL Island](https://sql-island.informatik.uni-kl.de/)

This is a fun interactive guide to SQL. It requires you to write some SQL queries to progress through the game. You might need to switch to the English version of the site. That can be done by clicking the menu icon top left and selecting the 4th item from the top ("Sprache wechseln").

**Note:** If this is not your first time learning SQL, you might find this guide too easy. In that case, you can skip it and go straight to the next exercise.

# Exercise: SQL Murder Mystery (1 hour)

Find the murderer in the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/walkthrough.html). If you manage to get through the exercise in under an hour, try to:
- get through the exercise using as few queries as possible. For example, using three queries from start to finish (apart from the `INSERT` for checking the solution)
- try to find out who is the real villain behind the crime

# Bonus: Select Star SQL (2.5 hours)

Finally, there is an exercise
