Part 4: Hands-on Exercise - Travel Agency Landing Page

You just received an email from the design team: they've completed the homepage design for a travel agency website and need your help to turn it into HTML and CSS code. They have provided you with screenshots of the full desktop and mobile version, some text snippets, SVG icons, and images, and an HTML page template. Your task is to create a responsive Travel Agency landing page based on the provided design.

# Task Description

Your goal is to recreate the provided design using the provided screenshots. It's important to note that you don't need pixel-perfect precision â€“ just getting the layout right is already a worthy achievement!

## Requirements

1. Recreate the provided design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
2. Implement 3 forms: search form at the very top, booking form in the middle, and a newsletter form at the bottom. Use appropriate field types.
3. Try to make the final result look good on both desktop and mobile screens.
4. Use the provided text snippets, SVG icons, and images as necessary.
5. Try to apply the provided "Montserrat" and "Dancing Script" fonts to match the fonts in the screenshot.

**Hints:**

- Try to minimize the feedback loop between your code and the browser. It's heavily recommended to install VS Code on your machine and to use an extension, such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to see your changes in the browser after every change you make.
- Try sketching out each section on paper. What does each section resemble? A grid? Or a more fluid layout that can be achieved with flexbox?
- Before trying to match the look of a particular element, try getting the rough layout right.
- Style the most visually significant elements first. For example, the header and the footer are the most visually significant elements on the page. Then move on to styling the less significant elements, such as the navigation bar and the booking form.
- Some elements are challenging to get right. If you've no idea how to work on a particular element - move on to other elements.
- If you have an idea, try to express it in words and search for it on Google or ask a chatbot for help. For example: "how to put an element on top of each other in CSS?"
- Preferably start with the mobile view first and then work your way up to a desktop view.
- You might need to wrap some of your elements in [Bootstrap containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/containers/) to keep them centered.
- You don't need to have any interactive elements or any additional pages.
- You can use `input[type="date"]` for the date fields.

## Recommended Step-by-Step Approach

Step 1: Analyze the design provided in screenshots, split it into sections
Step 2: Rebuild the general page structure in HTML with `div` elements
Step 3: Place all the missing HTML elements
Step 4: Choose a layout for each section
Step 5: Add applicable Bootstrap classes (inputs, buttons, containers)
Step 6: Add the most visually significant styles
Step 7: Identify key layout and spacing problems in the design
Step 8: Test the page on different resolutions
Step 9: Element-level styling (major)
Step 10: Element-level styling (minor)

## Bonus Challenges

- Try to match the design as closely as possible.
- Assign links that scroll down to the "Destinations" section.
- Add a CSS transition to fade in some page elements once the page is opened.
- Try out using CSS variables for repeating values, such as font families and colors.
- Add basic form validation so that each form requires all of its fields to have a value before it can be submitted. Add a limit of 10 guests to the booking form.

## Approach to Solving the Task

Follow this approach to tackle the hands-on exercise:

- Spend up to 10 hours attempting to solve the task on your own.
- If you struggle during the first hours and find it too difficult, try seeking help from your peers or JTLs for an additional 10 hours. Spend half of this time working with someone else, whether it's a study buddy, a peer who has completed the exercise, or a JTL in an open session.
- When you are no longer making any progress on your own, take a look at the suggested solution and walk through it step-by-step. Expect to spend up to 10 more hours on the walkthrough while experimenting and learning from the provided solution.
- The suggested solution has been split into 10 steps. Try to go back to your own solution once the suggested solution clears up any obstacles you encountered.
- Note: It's expected that you won't be able to solve the task on your own. The suggested solution is there to help you learn, not to make you feel bad about yourself. However, the trial-and-error process on its own will help you learn a lot more than just reading the suggested solution.
- If you manage to reach a solution looking like the screenshot below on your own, you have already learned a lot!
