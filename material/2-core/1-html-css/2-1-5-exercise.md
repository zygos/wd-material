Part 5: Travel Agency Website Expansion

Hey,

Nice work on the landing page! I knew I could count on you. We're
ready to expand the site with new pages and features. The
issue is that our design team is currently in a UI/UX conference
in the Bahamas ðŸŒ´, so they won't be able to provide you with
the designs. But I'm sure you'll do just fine without them!
I've informed the team that you're our 10x developer so that
they can focus on the business trip.

For this task, I'd like you to create four new pages for our
website:

1. Destinations Gallery
2. Individual Destination Page
3. Contact Us Form Page
4. Contact Form Success Page

Try to maintain the same look and feel as the landing page
you've already created. And, of course, make sure the site
works on an iPhone!

Also, if that seems like a piece of cake, I'd like you to
add some business casual pzazz to the site. You know, make
it pop! I'm thinking some animations. If you could do that,
that would be great...

Looking forward to seeing your work!

All the best,
Owen Overbudget

## Project description

By continuing on your hands-on solution or using the previously provided hands-on exercise solution, create 4 additional pages for the travel agency website that match the style and design of the landing page. Your goal is to expand the existing design with new pages and elements while preserving the visual style and a good user experience.

## The requirements you are given to implement are as follows:

- Create the **Destinations Gallery Page** page that displays a gallery of 12 destination images. The first item in the gallery should link to the **Individual Destination Page**. It should visually change on hover to indicate that it is clickable.
- Create a single **Individual Destination Page** that displays at least one destination image, a 3-paragraph description and a form to book a trip to this destination, similar to the form on the landing page. This page should also include a link back to the **Destinations Gallery Page**.
- Create a **Contact Form Page** that allows users to submit inquiries to the travel agency. Ensure to include the following fields: name, email, phone number and a message textarea. Make all fields required before the form can be submitted. Add a submit button. When the form is submitted, user should be directed to the **Contact Form Success Page**.
- Create a **Contact Form Success Page** that is displayed upon submission of the contact form. This page should thank the user for their inquiry. Add a link back to the **Homepage**.
- Ensure that the new pages are visually consistent with the existing landing page and look right on mobile screens and on desktops.
- Include links to the Destinations page and Contact page (instead of a "Sign in" button). Links should be in the header and the footer of the page.
- Update the homepage to include links to the destinations and contact form page.
- All pages should include the current page title in the header, for example "Contact Us", "Destinations" etc.
- Pages should use a smaller header section without the booking form.

## Additional notes

You will NOT be evaluated on:
- the long-form text content of the pages
- page performance, unless it hinders the user experience
- search engine optimization (SEO).

## Reviewer role
Different projects may require you to structure your presentation in different ways based on the imagined role of the reviewer. The goal is to practice interacting with different stakeholders that a developer will likely encounter in their careers.

In this project, imagine that you are presenting the pages to an enthusiastic project manager. The project manager is not a developer, but they are familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS. In addition, they are interested in seeing how your design choices represent the company's brand, and improve user experience, page accessibility, and responsiveness.

## Project evaluation criteria
- Consistency in design and branding across all pages.
- User experience: easy navigation from page to page.
- Page accessibility: images with alt tags, form inputs with labels and placeholders, some use of semantic HTML elements.
- Responsiveness: Adaptability across different devices and screen sizes (1920x1080, 768x1024, 360x740).
- Validation: HTML and CSS files have no `error` or `warning` level validation issues when checked with the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). `info` level warnings are acceptable.
- Quality of code: The HTML and CSS code is clean, organized, and maintainable.

During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.

**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask (a reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more, however!)**
- How do your design choices enhance the user experience?
- What challenges did you encounter in making the site fully responsive, and how did you overcome them?
- How did you ensure accessibility in your design? What elements and attributes did you use to improve accessibility?
- How easy would it be to make widespread changes to the code in the future, such as changing the color scheme?

## Bonus challenge

- Add some sleek transitions to the site to make it pop!
