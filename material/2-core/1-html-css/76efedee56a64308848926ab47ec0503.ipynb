    "  height: 100vh;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Laying out an item on top of an another item seems to be quite tricky.\n",
    "Let’s see if we can find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we Google “css text on top of image”, we find this a method using\n",
    "`relative` and `absolute` positioning. Let’s try that:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` css\n",
    ".destination {\n",
    "  /* Placement of child elements will be relative to this element */\n",
    "  position: relative;\n",

    "  bottom: 0;\n",
    "\n",

    "  text-align: center;\n",

    "\n",
    "This is not the only way to do this. We could also use `display: grid`\n",
    "and placing both image and text in the same grid cell. But this is a\n",
    "good example of how we can use Google to find solutions to our problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s fix the footer background color.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t know what color is used in the original design. But we can\n",
    "notice that it’s yellowish and it seems to be the same color as the Book\n",
    "button. We can use Developer Tools to check what is the exact button\n",
    "color. It seems to be `#ffc107`. Let’s use that:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` css\n",
    "footer {\n",
    "  background-color: #ffc107;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What about navigation links? Links, by default are display in an inline\n",

    "`display` type:\n",

    "**Step 7: Identify key layout and spacing problems in the design**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have made a lot of progress, but there are still some issues with our\n",
    "page: - items in the topbar are not aligned correctly - the header form\n",
    "is not aligned at the bottom - some elements and headlines are too close\n",
    "to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s fix them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, **let’s fix the topbar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’d like the search bar to be on the left, the logo straight in the\n",
    "middle and the menu icon hugging the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can accomplish that by giving instructing each element to align to a\n",
    "different side. First, let’s add wrapper `div` elements around the logo\n",
    "and menu icon:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` html\n",
    "<div id=\"topbar\">\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  <div id=\"logo\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./icons/globe-white.svg\" alt=\"Logo\" />\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "  <div id=\"menu\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./icons/three-bars-white.svg\" alt=\"Menu\" />\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use `display: flex` or `text-align` to align the elements\n",
    "correctly. I’ll use `display: flex` as it’s leaves us with more options\n",
    "if we want to change the layout later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` css\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Add `aria` attributes to `form` fields\n",
    "2.  Add `for` attribute to labels and poitn them to input fields\n",
    "3.  Add fallbacks to font-family rules\n",
    "4.  Add `alt` attributes to images\n",
    "5.  Add `title` attributes to links\n",
    "6.  Add `#destinations` to the “Destinations” link, so it scrolls to the\n",
    "    destinations section\n",
    "7.  Ensure there are styles for `:focus` and `:hover` states for all\n",
    "    interactive elements\n",
    "8.  Add `autocomplete` attribute to `form` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices: i. Do not use `destination` class for a destination\n",
    "field in the form and for the destinations section. This would result in\n",
    "a lot of confusion and bugs. ii. Add `name` for all `form` fields. iii.\n",
    "Do not apply styles to HTML elements directly. Use ids and classes\n",
    "instead. iv. Add `required` attribute to required form fields. v. Add\n",
    "validation to the `guest` field (for example, it could be a number\n",
    "between 1 and 10). vi. Use CSS variables for colors, fonts and other\n",
    "values that are used in multiple places. vii. Consider using CSS\n",
    "variables for most pixel values (such as `padding`, `margin`, etc.) to\n",
    "make sure they’re a multiple of some base value (such as 8px or 10px).\n",
    "viii. Add meta fields for social media sharing. ix. Do not apply styles\n",
    "to Bootstrap classes directly. Use custom ids and classes instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 12: Pixel pushing (optional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is absolutely not necessary for this task. But if you want to make\n",
    "your design pixel perfect, you can use a browser’s extension, such as\n",
    "[PixelParallel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelparallel-by-htmlburg/iffnoibnepbcloaaagchjonfplimpkob)\n",
    "or\n",
    "[PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi)\n",
    "for Chrome. It allows overlaying an image on top of a design and then\n",
    "adjusting the design until it matches the image."
