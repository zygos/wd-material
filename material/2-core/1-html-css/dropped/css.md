Follow along the **[CS50W Week 0 video](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/0/)** from **1:47:54**.

CSS preprocessors like Sass extend CSS with advanced features such as variables, nesting, and mixins. These tools can help improve code maintainability and reduce repetition in your stylesheets.

At this stage in your learning, you do not need to adopt Sass for your projects. However, it's good to be aware of such tools, as they can be valuable in more significant projects and collaborations. For now, continue using CSS as your primary styling language.
