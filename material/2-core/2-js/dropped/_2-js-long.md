Module 2: Front-end development
Sprint 2: Mastering JavaScript

Scenario: You were hired as a junior front-end developer at an e-commerce store. For the first few weeks, you were mainly fixing bugs in HTML and CSS. Recently, the company appointed a new team lead who is focused on code quality and keeping up with industry best practices. She reviewed the codebase and noticed several issues in the legacy code. The team lead informed you that you'll be working together to refactor the store's website by learning and applying JavaScript, DOM manipulation, Functional Programming patterns, async functions, Fetch API, localStorage and event handling. While you're still getting up to speed with JavaScript, she's giving you a week to learn the essentials and then get hands-on with the project.

## 1. JavaScript Fundamentals

a. Setup your local environment (Linux, Mac, or WSL on Windows)
  - Install Node (LTS version)
  - Recommended VS Code extensions:
    - Quokka.js for exploring JavaScript
    - ESLint for code linting
    - Live Server for live reloading
    - Trailing Spaces to highlight trailing spaces
    - vscode-icons for file icons
    - WSL if you're using WSL on Windows

b. Introduction to JavaScript
  - Syntax and Variables (var, let, const)
  - Conditionals and Loops
  - Strings (methods, template literals)
  - Arrays and Objects (methods, destructuring)

c. Functions and Advanced Topics
  - Function declaration and expression
  - Arrow functions
  - Default parameters
  - Callbacks
  - Async functions
  - Promises
  - Error Handling (try-catch)

## 2. Object-Oriented and Functional Programming Patterns in JavaScript
  a. Objects, Prototypes, and Classes
  b. Immutability and Mutability
  c. Array methods & functional patterns (map, filter, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex, flatMap)
  d. Closures, Scope, and Context
  e. (Optional) Recursion
  f. (Optional) Higher-order functions and currying

## 3. DOM Manipulation
  a. DOM tree and Element selection
  b. Events and Event handling
  c. Updating DOM elements
  d. Bonus: jQuery (optional if preferred)

## 4. Hands-on: Working with JavaScript and the DOM
You just received an email from the team lead outlining the first set of tasks to be completed. The main goal is to add interactivity to the product pages of the e-commerce website. Your task is to create a simple shopping cart that allows users to add items to their cart, remove items, and update quantities. To achieve this, you'll need to work with DOM manipulation, event handling and localStorage.

## 5. Practical project: Refactoring the E-commerce Store
Building upon your hands-on experience, you now need to help refactor the e-commerce store's website. Your team lead has highlighted a list of problematic areas, particularly in JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Identify and fix the issues, ensuring the website runs smoothly with optimized performance and user experience. Apply the knowledge you've gained on best practices, functional programming patterns, async functions, Fetch API, and event handling.
