Part 5: Typing Speed Test App

We hope you have familiarized yourself with typing speed tests and have a good understanding of how they work. We call this "foreshadowing" in the business.

In this coding task, you will create a Typing Speed Test app using vanilla JavaScript. The app will allow users to test their typing speed and accuracy by typing the displayed text within a given time frame. Users can then view their results and track their progress over time.

## Project description

You will design and implement a Typing Speed Test app that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. The app will retrieve text from a public API (such as [PoetryDB API](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb)) or a collection of text/words in JSON format in the project folder. In either case, text should be retrieved using the `fetch` API. The app will provide an intuitive interface to display the user's progress over time.

## The requirements you are given to implement are as follows:

- Using `fetch` retrieve a random piece of text from a public API or a custom collection of various English words or text pieces in JSON format.
- Display the text for the user to type.
- When a user starts typing, start a timer and run it for 60 seconds.
- Highlight each correctly typed character in a shade of green and every incorrectly typed character in a shade of red.
- Either highlight the current word or display it in a separate area.
- Allow the use of backspace to undo typed characters.
- When the timer ends, calculate and display the user's typing speed (WPM) and word accuracy (%). You can also calculate these metrics in real-time. Do not count words that were not typed correctly.
- Allow the user to reset and start again with a new piece of text.
- Allow using the "enter" key for restarting and the "esc" key for resetting the test.
- Store the user's metrics (speed and accuracy).
- Display the user's metrics over time in a visually appealing way (a table or a chart).
- After each attempt, indicate whether the user has improved over their previous attempts.
- Use module imports (and exports) to organize your code.

## Additional comments

- Interact with DOM elements for displaying text, user input, and results. You can interact with existing elements in static HTML and/or create new HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Use event listeners for user interactions (e.g., detecting input, and resetting the test).
- Store and retrieve user progress data using local storage.
- Display errors for failed API requests and other potential issues.
- Structure your code in a manner that would allow you to easily change key features without the need to know the entire codebase.
- You can use external CSS and JS libraries as long as they are not directly related to the typing test logic.
- Your code should be understandable by your peers. Where needed, add comments to explain non-trivial parts of your code.

If you find some requirement particularly challenging, you can try to implement it in a simpler way. For example, highlight correctly typed words instead of characters.

## Reviewer role

Present the app as if you were presenting it to a potential user. You will need to demonstrate how the application works. Explain the code as if you are explaining it to a technical team lead. Focus on explaining the most complicated parts of the code and how you implemented the requirements.

## Project evaluation criteria

- Typing test functionality: The application works according to the requirements.
- User metrics functionality: The application stores, retrieves and displays previous user results.
- User experience: The application is pleasant, intuitive, and easy to use - comparable to other typing speed test sites.
- Ease of making changes: The application is modeled in a way that makes it easy to change or add features.
- Code organization: Small functions with a clear single responsibility. Functions are organized into files. Use of classes or objects where encapsulation is needed.

During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.

**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask (a reviewer is encouraged and expected to think of more, however!)**

- What are event listeners and how do you use them in your app?
- What are higher-order functions and how did you use them in your code?
- How easy would it be to {add a new feature, change an existing feature, remove a feature}?
