Q5: What is the main difference between using `export default` and `export` when exporting a function in a JavaScript module?
a) `export default` can only be used once per module, while `export` can be used multiple times
b) `export default` can only be used with functions, while `export` can be used with any data type
c) `export default` can only be used with ES6 modules, while `export` can be used with both CommonJS and ES6 modules
d) `export default` exports the function as an object, while `export` exports the function as a named export
- Correct: a) `export default` can only be used once per module, while `export` can be used multiple times
