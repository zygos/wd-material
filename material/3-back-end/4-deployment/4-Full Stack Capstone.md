Part 4: Full-stack Capstone Project

Now, it is time to complete your full-stack capstone project! ðŸŽ‰

## Project description

For this sprint, you will take your full-stack development skills to the next level. Your application should be a culmination of all the knowledge and expertise you've gained throughout the previous modules, with a focus on the back end.

In this part, you aim to finish your full-stack application from the previous sprint while applying the best practices and techniques you've learned in this module.

This project is your chance to shine and show potential employers what you can create. It should be a portfolio piece that you are proud to showcase. However, remember to plan out and strategically allocate your time. You will likely need to make trade-offs, take shortcuts, and cut some features. That is fine. Document your planning and decision-making process, which will help you answer questions about your project. Your ability to estimate and manage time is critical.

Good luck!

## Technical requirements

Your application builds on top of the technical requirements from the previous sprint with a few additions:

- Full-stack monorepo project written in TypeScript.
- At least 90% back-end line test coverage.
- At least 8 E2E tests covering the key functionality and user flows.
- Authentication and Authorization.
- The project should be working and have a README file with instructions on how to run it and how to "poke" its existing functionality via tests, API calls, or a provided front-end.
- The project should be tested and deployed automatically via a CI/CD pipeline.
- The project should be hosted on the web, and you should provide a link to the live version in the README file.

Feel free to use previously provided examples and exercises as a reference for your deployment and CI/CD pipeline configuration.

## Reviewer role

As a reviewer, your role is to evaluate the project's technical aspects and its overall quality. You should assess the codebase for readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. You should also verify that the project meets the specified technical requirements, such as test coverage, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. You are also responsible for ensuring that the project is functional and the deployment process is sound.

During the review, engage with the project as if you were a new **senior developer responsible for reviewing a potential candidate's work**.

## Project evaluation criteria

The project will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- **Presentation skills**. Clarity of communication and how well the project's functionality is demonstrated.
- **Containerization, CI/CD pipeline, and deployment**. Use containers and a CI/CD pipeline to test and deploy the application in an automated manner.
- **Authorization, authentication, security**. User authentication, authorization, data validation, and consideration of security risks.
- **UX and ease of use**. The application is intuitive, user-friendly, and provides a pleasant user experience.
- **Code quality & best practices**. The code is well-organized, follows good programming practices, and could be handed over to another developer.
- **Test coverage**. Application tests key user flows in E2E tests and has at least 90% back-end line test coverage. Tests do not rely on implementation details that can change over time.
- **Technical challenge**. The project includes some challenging features that go beyond basic CRUD operations.
- **General understanding of topics from module 3**. The learner fully understands full-stack development, deployment concepts, and related technologies discussed in module 3.

During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics. You may also be asked to explain your code, justify your technical decisions, suggest improvements, and implement them on the spot.

**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask:**

- What are the main features of your application? How did you implement them?
- How does your application differ from other applications in this area?
- What are the main challenges you faced during the development process?
- How is your application automatically tested and deployed?
- What security risks have you not addressed in your application? What could be done to mitigate them?
