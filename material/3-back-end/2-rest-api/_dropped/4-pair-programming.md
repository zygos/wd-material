**Task: Implement the following new requirement:**

```
To organize articles, authors want to be able to associate articles with categories. Categories have a name and an ID.

API should allow:

- creating new categories
- providing a category ID when creating an article
- setting a category ID when updating (PATCH) an article
- get a list of categories directly through /categories endpoint

There can be many categories, but an article may optionally be associated only with a single category.

Which additional cases should be tested?
```
