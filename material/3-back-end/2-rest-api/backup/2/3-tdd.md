Part 3: Test Driven Development

# Part introduction

Writing tests in the back end is even more important than writing them in the front end. If you make a mistake in the back end, it can have hard-to-undo consequences. It can lead to data loss, security breaches, and potential legal issues.

We will also learn how to use **test doubles**, such as **mocks**, **spies**, and make our code more testable by isolating logic into **pure functions** and using **dependency injection** for our dependencies.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) (1 hour)

- Watch: [How TDD is related to Quality of Code ("Uncle" Bob, author of Clean Code)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is41fgDrqn0) (10 min)
- Watch: [Types of Unit Test in TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W40mpZP9xQQ) (20 min)

While we have briefly introduced you to test-first development, we primarily guided you through the process of adding tests to an existing project. It is better than not having tests. At the same time, **it can be hard to see the value of tests when your application already works**. At that moment, you, as a developer, have peaked (unearned) confidence in your code. You _kind of_ know it works because you just manually tested it, and you know how it works because you just wrote it. You could write tests... or move on to the next feature. So, tests are often added as an afterthought, if at all.

This short-term thinking is dangerous and can lead to a situation where seemingly any change will break something in unexpected ways that you can't predict. You might have experienced this yourself. Sometimes, trying to fix a bug in one place breaks something in another place. Or it may break it, and you do not notice it before it is time to deploy the application or, in our case, to present your project. This is called **regression** and is a common problem in software development, which gets worse as the project grows.

So, how can we avoid this? How can we integrate testing into our regular development process? When you think about it, **we are testing our applications all the time**, but not in an automated manner. We write some code, run the application, and check if it works. We are already testing our code, just very inefficiently. And then, if we add automated tests later, we are repeating the same job twice.

It is as if we had to export data from a database to an Excel file, so we do it by hand by copying and pasting rows across sheets, rearranging them, formatting them, etc. And once we finish the task, we write a script to automate this job for us. That does not make sense. **Why didn't we write the script in the first place??**

This is where **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** comes in. TDD is a software development practice where you **write tests before you write the code satisfying those tests**. The cycle of TDD is as follows:

1. Write a test for some requirement. Run the test. It fails because the code to fulfill this requirement has yet to exist.
2. Get the test to pass as quickly as possible. This usually means writing the most straightforward implementation that will make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code while making sure that the tests still pass.

It is also known as **Red-Green-Refactor** because of the color of the test results. When a test fails, it is red. When it passes, it is green.

Another way of putting it is - **make it fail**, **make it work**, **make it right**.

There are several benefits to using TDD:

- By writing out your expectations, **you get to think about the problem** from the right point of view before you write any code. This helps you understand the problem better and develop a better solution.
- It lays out what you are trying to achieve in a **step-by-step** manner, which you can follow to arrive at a solution
- Writing tests first usually results in **better tests and implementation** than writing tests after the fact.
- **You do not have to manually test your app every time you make a change.** That saves you time in the long term (and sometimes in the short term).
- It provides specifications for your code â€“ someone can look at the tests to understand what the code is supposed to do.
- It is an **excellent tool for learning** because you are always working in small steps with immediate feedback from your tests. This prevents you from getting stuck in a rabbit hole of trying to solve a problem that is too big all at once.

## Exercise: Refactoring Anagrams (3 hours)

**Note on Jest/Vitest compatibility.** Jest is a long-standing testing library for JavaScript. That is the reason why quite a few tutorials online involve Jest. However, Jest requires additional setup, which we would like to avoid so we can focus on the main topic of this section - writing tests. We are using a Vitest for this module as it has the same testing API as Jest, so **Jest and Vitest tutorials are mostly interchangeable**. On top of that, Vitest runs tests quite a bit faster than Jest, which is a nice bonus when learning the TDD workflow. So, **Vitest experience is transferable to Jest and vice versa**.

We will go through a few general ideas behind testing with a simple example of a program that displays a list of [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) for a given word. We will take the long road of refactoring the initial module to make it more testable and to demonstrate some testing techniques. It compactly illustrates multiple layers that we can test.

The application right now is a simple TypeScript module containing a variable for a word. When the module is run, it:

- displays the number of anagrams for a given word from a provided dictionary
- displays every anagram for a given word

**Step 0. Review the given example.**

**Note: We will go through `anagrams-0` - `anagrams-6` in this section.**

Download the provided exercises `zip` and extract it to some folder. Open up the `anagrams-0` folder in VS Code and install dependencies.

For a small playground-like script like this, we will skip setting up a larger linting/formatting toolchain and use `tsx` and `vitest` to run our code and tests.

Run `npm run start` to see the result. Look through the source code. It is a simple script that reads a dictionary file, splits it into words, and then filters out the anagrams for a given word. It then prints the number of anagrams and the list of anagrams to the console.

How would we test this micro application in an automated manner? While we can test it in its entirety, we would not want this to be our only option, as small changes would break lots of tests, and we would have no chance of covering all test cases.

Also, testing things in their entirety does not scale. Imagine a tiny application with 5 parts, each with 10 possible input/output combinations. Each part leads into another. If we can isolate each part correctly, we could write **5 parts x 10 tests = 50 tests** to test our application thoroughly. Not great, not terrible. But what if we can not isolate it? Well, it's 10 code branches leading to 10 more code branches, and so on. So, to cover the same number of combinations, we would need to write **10x10x10x10x10 = 100,000 tests**. **By making our modules easy to test, we allow ourselves to write FEWER tests, not more.**

Our anagram application started on the wrong path - on the path to 100,000 tests. Let's work on getting it back to a more sensible path. At the moment, there is no easy way to test this tiny application in an isolated manner because:

- it is entangled with I/O (input/output) - it directly reads from the file system and prints to the console.
- there is minimal separation of concerns - the same function deals with multiple concerns, so every test testing one concern would also touch the other.

It is easy to write code like this when you are just trying to get something to work. But it is hard to maintain and test code like this once it grows beyond this tiny problem space and other parts of your application rely on it.

For this small example, we are only left with an option to do an integration test, where we are testing the entire application as a whole. We can do this by running the application and checking for the correct output. This is not ideal because:

- it couples the test to the implementation - if we change the implementation - the dictionary, the logic, or the output method - **many of our tests will break**
- **it is hard to pinpoint the source of the error** - if the test fails, we do not know if it is because of the input, the logic, or the output
- **we will tend to overlook various cases** as we are not focused on each step of the process
- **integration tests are relatively slow** - we have to run the entire application (or an outsized portion) to test a small part.

We want to refactor it and make it more testable so our application is no longer on the path to 100,000 tests. But how can we do that?

**Step 1. Wrap current functionality in a test**

Because we were raised right, **we will do our best not to break what we already have**. We need to ensure that our micro project does not break in the refactoring process.

We will start by writing a test that will test our application at the lowest level, at which we can isolate its functionality. In our case, that is our entire application.

We will write a test to run our application and check the output. We will use Vitest to run our tests using `npm test`. We will run `npm test someFileName` to test a specific file.

Where should we create our first test? We could colocate it with our `src/index.ts`, and it is a preferred method for unit tests. However, we are not testing a single module but the entire application. It just so happens that our application is a single module. We will need something resembling an end-to-end test. So, for this instance, we will create a `tests` folder at the project root and create an `anagrams.test.ts` file there. Our `tests` folder will host our integration tests, ensuring that we do not break our current functionality throughout our refactoring.

We can start off with the regular initial plain setup and a test name:

```ts
import { it } from 'vitest';

it('should print anagrams from words.txt', async () => {
})
```

**We have two problems:**

1. We do not have to import from '../src/index.ts' as it has no declared exports.
2. We are unsure what to write in the test case.

Solve the first issue by exporting the `main` function as `default` from the `src/index.ts` file.

Then, we will be able to import it and use it in our test:

```ts
import printAnagrams from '../src'
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

it('should print anagrams from words.txt', async () => {
  await printAnagrams()

  // what should we expect?? The function does not return anything.
  // expect()
})
```

What should we expect from our function? How can we capture its effects in a test? There is one effect that we care about - the console output.

But how can we know what was printed on the console?

It is time to meet the **spy**. A spy is a function that records its calls (or calls of something else). We will go into spies and their close relatives later in this part. For now, we do not need to know how they work.

The neat part about spies is that we can easily create and attach them to various functions.

We can create a spy for the `console.log` function and check if it was called with the correct arguments.

In Vitest, it would be done with `vi.spyOn(console, 'log')`, like this:

```ts
import printAnagrams from '../src'
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest' // import vi utility functions

// we attach a spy for the console.log function
vi.spyOn(console, 'log')

it('should print anagrams from words.txt', async () => {
  await printAnagrams()

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('There are 2 anagrams in the dictionary:')
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('  - coed')
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('  - deco')
})
```

Now, if we run `npm test`, our test should pass. We have successfully wrapped our application in a test. We can now refactor our application without worrying about breaking it (too much). In a real-world application, we might need to add more tests to cover a few more scenarios so we do not risk breaking while refactoring. In our case, logging this particular string is the only thing our `index.ts` does because everything else is hardcoded.

From this point, we will keep our terminal constantly open with `npm test` running in the background. This will allow us to see if we break anything while refactoring.

**Step 2. Add a test to separate the anagram logic.**

The first step to make this code more testable is to isolate any piece of logic not directly related to system inputs and outputs - something that is **a pure function** - a function only concerned with its arguments and returning a value. It does not touch the file system; it does not modify its arguments along the way; it only returns a value. It is a function that is easy to test and to reason about. It is also easy to reuse and compose. Pure functions do not have **side-effects**, such as reading from the file system or printing to the console.

In our case, we could isolate everything between reading the dictionary and printing the results. We could call this function `getAnagrams`, which would return an array of anagrams for a given the word. Should our function read the dictionary provided, or should it be provided with a list of words? If we decide to change our dictionary in the future (maybe we want to use a different dictionary or a different format), we will have to change our function. Instead, we would like a function that encapsulates what it means to get a list of anagrams for any dictionary.

Let's create a new test file, which we will call `getAnagrams.spec.ts`. We will colocate it in the same location where we would place its implementation. It probably should be around `src/index.ts` as our `src/index.ts` will use it. So, let's add `src/getAnagrams.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import getAnagrams from './getAnagrams'

describe('getAnagrams', () => {
  it('should return an array of anagrams for the given word', () => {
    const dictionary = ['dusty', 'night']

    expect(getAnagrams(dictionary, 'study')).toEqual(['dusty'])
    expect(getAnagrams(dictionary, 'thing')).toEqual(['night'])
  })
})
```

**Note:** We called it a `getAnagrams.spec.ts` and not a `getAnagrams.test.ts`, as we will use it to specify the desired behavior up-front instead of just testing what we already have. Both suffixes are used interchangeably in practice as they have no hard distinction.

**Step 3. Make your test pass.**

1. Create a `getAnagrams.ts` file.
2. Move the necessary logic from the `src/index.ts` to the new file and make your test pass.
3. Your `getAnagrams` test and primary integration test should pass.

**Step 4. Refactor your implementation.**

There is a more elegant way to return a list of anagrams that communicates what you are trying to achieve. Spend some time to refactor your implementation to make it more readable.

**Step 5. Add additional test cases to ensure you cover a few more scenarios.**

Since we can easily test this isolated piece of logic, let's make sure we are covering the following scenarios:

```ts
it.todo('should return an empty array if there are no anagrams')
it.todo('should return an empty array if the dictionary is empty')
it.todo('should return an empty array if the word is empty')
it.todo('should not include partial anagrams') // e.g. 'cod' is not an anagram of 'code'
it.todo('should not include the word itself')
```

One by one, remove the `.todo` modifier and add the necessary test cases.

The current implementation has a few bugs that you need to fix. That is great! We have found a few bugs in our application, and we can resolve them in a few minutes instead of seeing them in live production, which might take A LOT more time to fix and might lead to frustration for our users.

We have covered some reasonable test cases. We could add more, but we will leave this for now. We, as developers, are pretty limited in time, so we should focus on the most critical cases first. We can always come back and add more tests later. We have done the most important part by making our code more testable.

**Note:** Given that our `getAnagrams` function is not exposed directly to the user, we rely on TypeScript to enforce the correct usage of the function, so we do not need to perform input type validation in this function. Generally, you would like to validate your input as close to the application "surface" - close to the data source. In that case, you can be sure that the data you are working with is valid, and you do not need to worry about it in the rest of your application. Right now, `getAnagrams` lives inside our application and is not close to any data source (file system, user input, external APIs, database), so it does not need to validate its input needlessly. However, if we were to expose it to the user, we would need to start coding defensively and validate all inputs meticulously.

Once done, you can review the `anagrams-5` folder for a possible solution.

**Step 6. Extract the message-forming logic into its module.**

We have captured the general concept of getting anagrams from a dictionary in a function. We can change and test that part of our application without caring about the rest. However, we still have essential pieces of our application that need to be covered by our tests. Let's continue with the same approach of extracting pure logic and isolating the logic responsible for forming the message we print later.

Move the logic responsible for forming the entire message to a separate file. It will take in everything it needs to form the message and return it as a string. Our printed-out messages reference only one variable - the list of anagrams. So, our function must take in that variable and return a string.

We would then call it from our `index.ts` like this:

```ts
async function showAnagrams(word: string) {
  const dictionary = (await fs.readFile(DICT, 'utf-8')).split('\n')
  const anagrams = getAnagrams(dictionary, word)
  const message = formMessage(anagrams)

  message.split('\n').forEach(line => console.log(line))
}
```

We can create a new test file called `formMessage.spec.ts` and write a simple test case to generate a complete message for a given word and a list of anagrams. We can greedily capture the entire message that requires multiple `console.log` calls in a single string.

```ts
import { expect, it } from 'vitest';
import formMessage from './formMessage';

it('should display a message for a given list of anagrams', () => {
  const anagrams = ['dusty', 'study'];

  expect(formMessage(anagrams)).toEqual(
    `There are 2 anagrams in the dictionary:
  - dusty
  - study`);
})
```

Move the message-forming logic from the `src/index` to a new file - `formMessage.ts`. Make sure that all your tests pass. Once your tests pass, you can spend a few minutes refactoring your implementation to make it more readable.

You might also notice that now that our code is isolated, **we can more easily see various edge cases**, such as:

- what if there is only one anagram? We would have "There are 1 anagrams..." message, which is not grammatically correct.
- what if there are no anagrams? We would have "There are 0 anagrams... :" message, which ends with a colon `:` and nothing after it, which seems out of place.

Once we isolate our logic, these cases become very easy to notice. We can then add test cases to `formMessage.ts` to cover these scenarios.

**Add tests for these scenarios and make sure they pass.**

Once you are done, you can check the `anagrams-6` folder for a possible solution.

## Exercise: Test Doubles and Mocks (1 hour)

We have managed to extract and move all pure functions from our main module into their own testable walled gardens. However, we can not test `showAnagrams` without an integration test against a real file system. Imagine that this function made slow HTTP requests, possibly to some rate-limited API. Now, you must wait for a long time to run your tests. Or imagine that it was writing to a database. You should have to set up a database and make sure that it is in a consistent state before each test. This can take a lot of time and make your tests slow.

We want to isolate our `showAnagrams` function from the file system and ensure it works with any dictionary file, not necessarily our current `words.txt` file.

What should we do in this case?

We can address this by **mocking our function calls**. What are mocks? We generally recommend to use the definitions by Gerard Meszaros and Martin Fowler:

- **Read: [TestDouble](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html)**

Colloquially, though, the term "mock" is sometimes used to refer to various types of test doubles.

**Step 7. Add a test for displaying the results.**

Our `showAnagrams` function relies on finding some data from the file system.

Vitest has built-in support for various types of test doubles. You can find more information about them in [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html). Mocking in Vitest works much like mocking in Jest. You can use any Jest tutorial for Vitest tests. While jest uses the `jest` global variable, Vitest uses the `vi` imported variable. For example, `jest.spyOn()` is equivalent to `vi.spyOn()`.

Add a test file `showAnagrams.spec` to test our isolated function `showAnagrams` that will work with any dictionary path and word.

`index.ts` will end up containing only the following:

```ts
import { join } from 'path'
import showAnagrams from './showAnagrams'

// preserving our original configuration
export default async function main() {
  const DICT = join(__dirname, '../words.txt')
  const WORD = 'code'

  return showAnagrams(DICT, WORD)
}

// if it is run directly, run the main function
if (require.main === module) main()
```

Here is the test example (`showAnagrams.spec.ts`):

```ts
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest'
import showAnagrams from './showAnagrams'

vi.spyOn(console, 'log')

it('should print a list of anagrams to the console found in the dictionary path', async () => {
  await showAnagrams('./words.txt', 'study')

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('There is 1 anagram in the dictionary:')
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('  - dusty')
})

```

Refactor your `showAnagrams.ts` to make all your tests pass. Use `showAnagrams` in `index.ts`.

**Step 8. Isolate reading from the file system.**

We have managed to isolate the logic responsible for displaying the results. However, we are still reading from an actual file system. If we add a few more words to our dictionary file, our `showAnagrams` test will break, which is incorrect. `showAnagrams` is doing its job perfectly. The `words.txt` failed on it. It is fine to capture that kind of error in an integration error. However, a reusable module, such as `showAnagrams` should be isolated from any file not embedded in it, breaking its tests. If `showAnagrams.ts` implementation does not ever mention `words.txt` in its code, it should not break if `words.txt` is changed or even removed. The fault lies at the consumer of `showAnagrams` - `index.ts` - providing the path of a no longer existing file.

We can isolate it with a `vi.mock` function. This function will allow us to provide a fake implementation for a module. We can then use this fake implementation to test our function.

```ts
// Technically, this can be considered a stub, because we are
// providing a fake implementation of a module sufficient for our test.
// For mocking an entire module:
// We mock the fs/promises module by providing a function that returns
// a fake implementation of the module
vi.mock('fs/promises', () => ({
  // Here we are mocking 2 different parts of our module.
  // We would not necessarily need to mock both of them. But we are doing it
  // to keep our test isolated from a change of import style:
  // - import fs from 'fs/promises'     // using import the default export
  // - import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'   // importing a named export
  default: {
    readFile: async () => 'dusty\nstudy',
  },

  // when doing import { readFile } from 'fs/promises', we will get this function
  readFile: async () => 'dusty\nstudy',
}))
```

We can then change our test to read from a non-existent file:

```ts
it('should print a list of anagrams to the console found in the dictionary path', async () => {
  await showAnagrams('./not-actual-file.txt', 'study');

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('There is 1 anagram in the dictionary:');
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('  - dusty');
})
```

Our isolated unit test should still pass.

We have kept our test separate from real I/O by mocking the `fs` package. We can now change the contents of the file system without affecting our test for our generic `showAnagrams` function. However, our **integration test would still catch errors** related to not seeing the right output for the particular dictionary file we are currently using.

You can check out the `anagrams-8` folder for a possible solution.

## Code coverage (0.5 hours)

**Code coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of code that is "touched" by running tests**. It is a valuable metric to check which parts of your applications lack tests. Code coverage can not tell much about your test quality, but it can point you to parts of your application that are not tested.

As an analogy, imagine a metric called "water coverage" for a washing machine. It cannot tell if your clothes got adequately washed, but it can tell if they got wet. That is a good start, but it only tells part of the story.

We should have done a pretty good job in our simple example, but have we covered all of it?

**Step 9. Investigate your code coverage.**

Vitest has some easy instructions on how to set up code coverage. You can find them in [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage.html).

In our case, we can run `npm i -D @vitest/coverage-v8`, add `"coverage": "vitest run --coverage"` to `package.json` `scripts` for ease-of-use and inform Vitest that we want to use the V8 coverage provider in a new `vitest.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8', // uses @bcoe/v8-coverage behind the scenes
    },
  },
})
```

Run `npm run coverage`. You should see the summary of results in your terminal.

Now, open up the generated `coverage/index.html` file. You can open it in your file browser or by right-clicking `coverage/index.html` in VS Code and selecting "Open with Live Server", given you have the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension installed.

Familiarize yourself with the interface. You can see that we have very high code coverage. You should find at least 1 line that needs to be covered. Should it be covered, or is it reasonable that it has escaped our tests?

Code coverage is a valuable metric to track, but it should not become an end in itself. Do not get the idea that maximizing a code coverage metric is the goal of testing. It is not. There are many ways to cheat this metric by simply doing an integration test that checks a single optimistic scenario. Then, you would have high test coverage, but your application would not be tested well.

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" - [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).

**Instead of maximizing a metric, focus on adopting practices aligned with the underlying reason why that metric is measured.**

## Dependency injection (1 hour)

We have used a light TDD flow for our refactoring. However, mocking every dependency this way has some serious drawbacks:

- it is fragile - if we change the implementation details, such as the used file system package, we must also change our unit tests. This is not ideal because our tests become just as coupled to implementation details as our code. Changing one usually requires changing the other. Ideally, we want to be free to change our code and not break our tests as long as our module does what it should.
- technical limitations when mocking modules and global variables - we can not interact with imported module-level mocks easily in our tests, which makes it hard to test some scenarios
- mocking modules and globals is a very blunt tool that often leads to lots of ugly procedural code when we want to test various scenarios with different mocks that involve sad paths, etc. Since our mocks are global, we must start involving mock resets and clears.
- we lose the ability to appropriately mocked tools in our tests - if we mock out `console.log` and we try to use it in our tests just for debugging purposes, it would not work (if mocked), or our tests would break (if spied and we check the number of calls in our test).

We can address these issues by using **dependency injection**. Dependency injection is a technique where we provide dependencies to modules instead of relying on global variables or module-level imports. This allows us to easily swap out dependencies in our tests without doing any "magic" behind the scenes where we are intercepting module imports.

The simplest example of a dependency injection is a function that takes in a dependency as an argument:

```ts
// without DI - tricky to test
function logError(error: Error) {
  console.error(error)
}

// with DI - very easy to test
type Log = (error: Error) => void

function logError(log: Log, error: Error) {
  log(error)
}
```

## Exercise: Anagrams with dependency injection (2 hours)

Let's apply dependency injection to our anagram example. What should we inject?

We could inject every dependency we have, including internal and external ones. However, we generally inject dependencies we want to swap out or make our code hard to test.

We can consider injecting two functions that would isolate us from our current assumptions about how we get and display the results:

- one that could retrieve a list of words from any data source: file system, internet, database, etc.
- one that could display the result message in any way: console, request-response, writing to a file, etc.

**Step 11. Refactor the showAnagrams to use a desired interface.**

Our test currently looks something like this:

```ts
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest'
import showAnagrams from './showAnagrams'

vi.spyOn(console, 'log');

vi.mock('fs/promises', () => ({
  default: {
    // does not have to be async, but the real readFile function is async, so
    // we will keep it that way to preserve the same interface
    readFile: async () => 'dusty\nstudy',
  },
  readFile: async () => 'dusty\nstudy',
}))

it('should print a list of anagrams to the console found in the dictionary path', async () => {
  await showAnagrams('./not-actual-file.txt', 'study');

  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('There is 1 anagram in the dictionary:');
  expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('  - dusty');
})

```

Let's imagine we want our `showAnagrams` to no longer be responsible for choosing how it will get and display the results. Instead, it will be provided with 2 functions that it can use to get and display the results. This will make it easier to reuse in more abstract scenarios and tests.

How would we like to use our `showAnagrams` function in an ideal world? Let's assume this function must be responsible for getting and displaying results, but it does not need to be responsible for choosing how to do it as we want to make it easy to swap out these parts.

What is in common with all these strategies that return a list of words? Well... they return a list of words!

So even a function like this should work:

```ts
const getDictionary = () => ['dusty', 'study']
```

What is in common with any strategy for displaying the results? They accept a string and hopefully do something with it. So this should work:

```ts
// this is not doing anything
const print = (message: string) => {}
```

We then could functions of that type to our `showAnagrams` function, so our test looks like this:

```ts
import { expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import showAnagrams from './showAnagrams';

// no more mocking modules!
// now our test works with any getDictionary and print functions

it('should print a list of anagrams to the console found in the dictionary path', async () => {
  // vi.fn creates an auto-spied mock function that does not care about
  // inputs and returns nothing, perfect for our fake print function
  const print = vi.fn();

  await showAnagrams(
    () => ['dusty', 'word'],
    print,
    'study',
  );

  expect(print).toHaveBeenCalledWith('There is 1 anagram in the dictionary:\n  - dusty');
});
```

**Update your `showAnagrams.ts` to pass the `showAnagrams` tests.** You can run `npm test showAnagrams` to run only the `showAnagrams` tests. We will go back to the integration test in the next step.

**Note:** In this simple example, we could take away the responsibility of getting the list of words and displaying the result from the `showAnagrams` function. That might be a decision we would make if this were our actual application in the real world. However, we might not have this possibility in various cases where the logic is slightly more coupled, so we will work with the constraint that the `showAnagrams` function must be responsible for getting and displaying the results.

<details>
  <summary>Click to see a hint</summary>

  ```ts
  // Our showAnagrams will accept 2 functions with an interface that showAnagrams wants
  // to deal with.
  // Getting a list of words is simply any function that returns a list of words - string[].
  // We allow asynchronous functions too (file system, internet, db...). We could exclusively
  // demand all functions to be asynchronous, but in this case, we choose to make our interface
  // more permissive. You can choose to make it more strict if you want to.
  type GetDictionary = () => string[] | Promise<string[]>

  // Printing is simply a function that takes a string, and we do not care about the return value.
  // Technical note - we might want to allow the function to return a Promise<void> to allow
  // for asynchronous error propagation, but that's unimportant for this example.
  type Print = (message: string) => any

  export default async function showAnagrams(
    getDictionary: GetDictionary,
    print: Print,
    word: string
  ) {
    // update your current showAnagrams to use the injected functions
  }
  ```
</details>

**Step 12. Update your integration test and src/index.ts to use the new interface.**

Since `showAnagrams` is no longer responsible for picking the tools for the job, this responsibility bubbles up to its consumer/call - the `src/index.ts`. Update `index.ts` and ensure all tests pass (`npm test`).

Once done, review the `anagrams-12` folder for a possible solution. We have also changed the application behavior in a minor way - instead of making multiple print calls, we are batching them in a single call. This is a little change that does not affect the behavior of our application, but it makes it slightly easier to test and refactor without affecting the user-facing behavior.

**Step 13. Experiment with different strategies.**

Our `showAnagrams` is very flexible now. We can easily swap out the technical details of how we get and display the results. Let's try it out.

```ts
// showAnagrams.spec.ts, an additional test case:

it('should allow printing a list of anagrams from the internet', async () => {
  const print = vi.fn();

  await showAnagrams(
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt');

      return (await response.text()).split('\n')
    },
    print,
    'code',
  );

  // in this case, it is quite fine to have a wrong assertion first
  // and then adapt it to the actual output. Our unit tests
  // are robust enough that we can be confident that our function
  // is working as expected.
  expect(print).toHaveBeenCalledWith([
    'There are 3 anagrams in the dictionary:',
    '  - coed',
    '  - deco',
    '  - ecod',
  ].join('\n'));
})
```

Here we are using actual `fetch`, but we could mock it out to make our tests faster and less flaky. We could also use a different strategy for getting the list of words, such as reading from a database. We could also write our results to a file, send them to a server, etc. We could run a simplified test suit with a fake database, fake requests, and so on while in development, and we could let our testing machine in the cloud to check the real thing before we deploy. The possibilities are endless.

We could then copy-paste this test to new `showAnagramsFromWeb(url)`, `showAnagramsFromDatabase(database)` functions to encapsulate these strategies into an easy-to-use interface. Our single `showAnagrams` function can now handle many different scenarios. We can easily swap out the technical details of how we get and display the results. We can also quickly test it without any mocks or stubs, though we can do so if we want to. Transitioning between a unit test and an integration test simply means changing the injected functions and modules.

We also could shift around the responsibilities between our modules. For example, we could decide that we want our application's `print` part to form its message string given a list of matched anagrams. We could decide we want multiple anagram strategies - matching partial anagrams, matching multi-word anagrams, etc. No matter what we choose, our application is in a better shape to handle these changes, especially if they need to be selected at runtime.

It might seem like a lot of work for a simple example like this. That is because our main logic is elementary. However, in a real-world application, our main logic might be much more complicated, and this approach would make it much easier to test, refactor, and change. The hard part might be to develop a good interface for our dependencies and decide what should be our module's responsibility and its consumer's responsibility (caller).

## Dependency injection with objects (1 hour)

It is straightforward to use dependency injection with functions. However, what if we inject a dependency for many functions, for example, for an entire module?

Let's say we have a file `user/model.ts` that contains functions necessary to work with `user` table in our database.

```ts
// we will use pseudo-code for database methods
import database from '@/database'

function createUser(user: User) {
  return db.insertInto('user').values(user)
}

function findUser(id: number) {
  return db.selectFrom('user').where({ id }).first()
}

function updateUser(id: number, userData: User) {
  return db.update('user').where({ id }).values(userData)
}
```

Let's also say that testing with mocks that intercept `@/database` module imports starts causing various issues and makes our tests harder to read and maintain.

We want to restructure our code to make it easier to test. How could we pass a database instance into these functions for easier testing?

There are various approaches, such as:

1. Passing a database instance into each function.
2. Wrapping everything inside a function which returns an object with all the functions.
3. Using a class that accepts a database instance in its constructor and exposes all the functions as methods.

Here is what each of them would look like:

```ts
// 1. Passing a database instance into each function
export function createUser(db: Database, user: User) {
  return db.insertInto('user').values(user)
}

export function findUser(db: Database, id: number) {
  return db.selectFrom('user').where({ id }).first()
}

export function updateUser(db: Database, id: number, userData: User) {
  return db.update('user').where({ id }).values(userData)
}

// usage
createUser(db, user)
```

1. This approach is relatively straightforward. However, by default, it is quite lengthy, and we will need to pass around the database instance to all required functions, which introduces additional complexity. Now, every function that wants to work with the User model needs to know that it needs to pass in a database instance, which mixes the concerns, which is not ideal. This simple approach has a few interesting advantages:

- very easy to test
- easy to refactor our code into separate modules with isolated tests as everything is ready to be moved to a separate module
- there are advanced techniques that can make this approach more elegant, such as partial application/currying, but we will not cover them now

```ts
// 2. wrapping everything inside a function which then returns
// an object with all the functions
export default (db: Database) => ({ // same as return { ... }
  createUser(user: User) {
    return db.insertInto('user').values(user)
  },

  findUser(id: number) {
    return db.selectFrom('user').where({ id }).first()
  },

  updateUser(id: number, userData: User) {
    return db.update('user').where({ id }).values(userData)
  },
})

// usage
const userModel = UserModel(db)
userModel.createUser(user)
```

2. This is called a **factory function**, and it is a common JavaScript pattern. It is just a function returning an object, but it does the job. We can easily inject a database instance, which is available for the methods we define inside the object. This technique has a few unique advantages over classes:

- it can be created asynchronously without any initialization methods
- it is easy to move functions to separate modules as nothing depends on `this` keyword
- it can destructured so we can use and pass around only the methods we need
- everything that is not returned is automatically private, so we have safe-by-default private/public separation

```ts
// 3. using a class that accepts a database instance in its
// constructor and exposes all the functions as methods
export default class UserModel {
  constructor(private db: Database) {}

  createUser(user: User) {
    return this.db.insertInto('user').values(user)
  }

  findUser(id: number) {
    return this.db.selectFrom('user').where({ id }).first()
  }

  updateUser(id: number, userData: User) {
    return this.db.update('user').where({ id }).values(userData)
  }
}

// usage
const userModel = new UserModel(db)
userModel.createUser(user)
```

3. This approach is also quite good and allows for injecting a different database instance easily. It also has a few unique advantages over factory functions:

- for high instance counts (1000s of instances), it is more performant than creating objects literals through factory functions
- a clear and familiar structure for anyone with an OOP background
- allows the use of inheritance
- methods to check whether an object is an instance of a class and not just an object with the same type signature

All three approaches are valid and can be used in different scenarios.

There are two additional `anagrams` examples for these techniques. Both solutions use a different anagram algorithm, which performs some pre-computing for object-based design to make more sense.

- You can review code in the provided `anagrams-example-functions` folder for a factory-function-based Anagrams solution.
- You can review code in the provided `anagrams-example-classes` folder for a class-based Anagrams solution.

JavaScript allows dependency injection with classes, function factories, and factory functions.

```ts
// function factory - function that produces a function ready for use
const displayNode = (log) => (name, value) =>
  log(`Node Name: ${name}, Node Value: ${value}`);

// does not do anything yet
const logNode = displayNode(console.log);

displayNode1('Node1', 10); // Output: Node Name: Node1, Node Value: 10

// another example using currying
const greet = greeting => name => `${greeting}, ${name}!`;

const greetInEnglish = greet('Hello');
const greetInLithuanian = greet('Labas');
const greetInSwahili = greet('Habari');

greetInEnglish('Mary'); // Hello, Mary!
greetInLithuanian('Carlos'); // Labas, Carlos!
greetInSwahili('Medina'); // Habari, Medina!
```

```ts
// factory function - a function that produces an object
// within its closure
function createNode(log, name, value) { // could use => syntax
  return {
    name,
    value,
    toString() {
      log(`Node Name: ${this.name}, Node Value: ${this.value}`);
    }
  };
}

const node = createNode(console.log, 'Node1', 10);

node.toString(); // Output: Node Name: Node1, Node Value: 10
```

```ts
// class - a blueprint for creating objects
class Node {
  constructor(log, name, value) {
    this.name = name;
    this.value = value;
    this.log = log;
  }

  toString() {
    this.log(`Node Name: ${this.name}, Node Value: ${this.value}`);
  }
}

const node = new Node(console.log, 'Node1', 10);

node.toString(); // Output: Node Name: Node1, Node Value: 10
```

Which structure should you prefer? There are no hard rules. However, some guidelines can help you make a decision:

- choose the simplest structure that gets the job done given reasonable expectations for possible changes
- choose what is the most familiar to your team and what is the most idiomatic for your framework
- if a module is a singleton that does not require any instantiation - export plain functions directly - utilities, helpers, validation functions, etc.
- if your module is satisfying a small task with no state changes over time - use a higher-order function (function factory) if you need to inject a few dependencies
- if you are creating 1000s of instances in a short period of time - use classes, as they are more performant since all function definitions are reused across instances in the prototype chain. This does not apply if you are immediately disposing of the instances.
- if you want to encapsulate all module behavior with a long-lived state - prefer classes. Example - databases, connections to remote servers, etc.
- if you are creating a limited number of instances and you want to be able to have lots of flexibility while using composition over inheritance - use function factories
