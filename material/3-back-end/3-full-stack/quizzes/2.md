2. When using tRPC, how does the client know about the available endpoints and their associated types?
a) Through manual inspection of the server code
b) By using TypeScript's type inference on JSON responses
c) By generating code for client-side types based on the server's schema
d) Through passed in server router type

4. What does the term "design by contract" imply in the context of web development?
a) A legal agreement between two companies that defines the terms of their collaboration
b) A specification that defines the expected interface of a software component
c) A layout design for web pages that is contractually agreed in advance
d) A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the front-end and back-end developers

5. In GraphQL and tRPC, what differentiates a 'mutation' from a 'query'?
a) Mutations are always GET requests
b) Mutations are for reading data; queries are for writing data
c) Mutations change the state of the server; queries do not
d) Mutations deal with mutable data structures; queries deal with immutable data structures
- Correct: c) Mutations change the state of the server; queries do not

6. How do the `pick` and `omit` functions provided by JavaScript libraries like Zod, Lodash, and Ramda differ in their approach to handling object properties?
a) `pick` discards object properties based on a given predicate, while `omit` generates a new object without the indicated properties.
b) `pick` generates a new object based on a specified condition, whereas `omit` discards object properties based on a given condition.
c) `pick` is used for picking the first object in an array that matches a given condition, while `omit` is used for omitting the first object that matches a given condition.
d) `pick` produces a new object containing only certain properties of the original object, while `omit` generates a new object that lacks the properties specified.
- Correct: d) `pick` produces a new object containing only certain properties of the original object, while `omit` generates a new object that lacks the properties specified.

b) RPC
c) GraphQL
d) WebSocket
