// You could add some helpers here to make it easier to test your API.
// Instead of going through the same signup/login steps for every test,
// you could create and login a fresh user for every test. If it is done
// through API, it will be much faster than going through the UI.
// As long as you have one flow that tests the UI signup/login, you can
// start relying on API for some more cumbersome E2E tasks.
// There are some alternative strategies, such as mocking the API or using
// a seeded database. However, that generally requires more front-to-back
// coordination and is more brittle to changes in the API.

  // 5. Set the access token in localStorage. This deals with implementation
  // details, so it is not ideal, but as long as we isolate it to a single
  // place, it should be fine.
