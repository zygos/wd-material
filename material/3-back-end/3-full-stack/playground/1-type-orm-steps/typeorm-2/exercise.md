Create a new Rating entity in a new rating.ts file.

Rating has:

- movieId (always integer)
- votes (always integer)
- rating (can be a decimal number)

Decide on the column data types yourself.

You will need to add it make it available in the index.ts as it is responsible for re-exporting all entities so the database can conveniently import them.
