Parking Charge Calculator.

Write a function `calculateParkingCharge` calculating the Parking Charge Based on Date timestamp of arrival and timestamp of departure. Parking between 8 - 18 hours costs 2 euro per hour, every other time costs 1 euro per hour. It should always round up to the nearest hour. For example, 2 hours 1 minute rounds up to 3 hours. You can assume your local timezone.
