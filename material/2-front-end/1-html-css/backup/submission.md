Before submitting your project, double check that you have saved your progress to your GitHub repository. Once you have done that, click the "Submit project" button in the Turing Platform. The platform then allows you to see the times when reviewers are available to have a call with you and review the project. Simply book a time that suits you. If there are no times available, feel free to message us in the #community_help channel on Discord — we will make sure that a reviewer adds a time for you.

You should also add times for reviewing others as well by clicking on "My Availability". Note that receiving a review costs 1 Correction Point. Once you run out of correction points, you will not be able to progress further until you review at least one other learner. Performing a review awards you with 2 correction points. We strongly suggest adding availability slots regularly as it might take some time until somebody books a review with you. Once somebody books a correction with you, you will be notified via email – make sure not to miss it and review the uploaded work beforehand!
