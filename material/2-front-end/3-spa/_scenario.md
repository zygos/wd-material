Scenario: You were hired as a junior front-end developer at an e-commerce store. For the first few weeks, you were mainly fixing bugs in HTML and CSS. Recently, the company appointed a new team lead who is focused on code quality and keeping up with industry best practices. She reviewed the codebase and noticed several issues in the legacy code. The team lead informed you that you'll be working together to refactor the store's website by learning and applying JavaScript, DOM manipulation, Functional Programming patterns, async functions, Fetch API, localStorage and event handling. While you're still getting up to speed with JavaScript, she has given you a week to learn the essentials and then get hands-on with the project.
