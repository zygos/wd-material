In this part, we will delve deeper into Node.js, exploring advanced concepts such as Streams and Buffers, Error Handling and Debugging, Event Emitters, and Queues and Message Brokers. We will also look at performance optimizations in Node.js.

**Exercise 1: Implementing Streams and Buffers**
In this exercise, you will create a simple file upload server using Node.js streams and buffers. You will need to handle large file uploads efficiently using streams and buffers.

**Exercise 2: Debugging Node.js Applications**
For this exercise, you will be given a buggy Node.js application. Your task is to identify and fix the bugs using Chrome DevTools.
