### Sprint 1: Advanced Node.js Concepts and Interview Preparation

#### Part 1: Advanced Node.js Concepts: Streams and Buffers

##### Real-world scenario:
Imagine a company, Streamline Solutions, that specializes in data analytics and processes large datasets. They've been experiencing performance bottlenecks with their current Node.js application, which reads and processes large log files.

##### Practical problems:
- The existing application reads entire log files into memory before processing. This approach consumes a significant amount of memory and isn't scalable.
- The application is slow, especially when dealing with log files that are several gigabytes in size.

##### Insufficiency of previous tools:
Previously introduced basic file reading techniques using modules like `fs` aren't capable of handling such large datasets efficiently, leading to memory overflow and slow processing times.

##### New tools and pragmatic solutions:
- Introduce **Streams** in Node.js which can read and write data in chunks without consuming large amounts of memory.
- Discuss the use of **Buffers** for handling binary data streams.
  
##### Transitioning to the next concept:
After understanding how Streams and Buffers can greatly improve performance, we'll explore error handling and debugging to ensure that our stream-based applications are robust and maintainable.

#### Part 2: Error Handling and Debugging in Node.js

##### Real-world scenario:
Streamline Solutions realized that their application crashes occasionally without clear error messages, making debugging a nightmare.

##### Practical problems:
- Unhandled stream errors can crash the Node.js process.
- Debugging asynchronous code can be challenging without proper tools and techniques.

##### Insufficiency of previous tools:
Basic `try-catch` error handling isn't effective for asynchronous stream errors, and console-based debugging is time-consuming and inefficient for complex applications.

##### New tools and pragmatic solutions:
- Implement advanced error handling techniques for streams.
- Use Node.js debugging tools, such as the built-in `debugger`, Chrome DevTools, and community packages like `ndb` or `node-inspector`.

##### Transitioning to the next concept:
With a solid handling of errors and debugging practices in place, let's look into how we can structure our code with OOP and FP patterns to make it more modular, maintainable, and testable.

#### Part 3: OOP and FP Patterns in JavaScript

##### Real-world scenario:
A fintech startup, QuickFinance, is scaling up its Node.js application. The codebase is becoming complex, and the development team is looking for patterns to structure their growing number of modules and functionalities.

##### Practical problems:
- As the codebase grows, it becomes harder to manage dependencies and side effects.
- The team needs a scalable architecture that can accommodate new features and services.

##### Insufficiency of previous tools:
The procedural or functional programming styles used initially are no longer sufficient for the complex, stateful interactions within the application.

##### New tools and pragmatic solutions:
- Discuss the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Introduce Functional Programming (FP) concepts like pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions.
- Show how OOP and FP can be combined in JavaScript to leverage the benefits of both paradigms.

##### Transitioning to the next concept:
Now that we have the architectural patterns down, let's apply our knowledge to solve algorithmic challenges that we might face in a real-life interview setting.

#### Part 4: Hands-on: Algorithms

##### Practical exercise:
Participants will be given a series of algorithmic challenges that mirror the kinds of problems they might encounter during technical interviews. These exercises will focus on data structures, sorting, searching, and optimization problems.

##### Real-world connection:
The exercises will be based on real-world scenarios from tech companies like optimizing route planning for delivery services or developing algorithms for financial trading systems.

##### Pragmatic application:
Each problem will require participants to utilize the advanced JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript concepts they've learned so far to come up with efficient and scalable solutions.

##### No new material:
Participants will focus on applying their existing knowledge to solve these problems, reinforcing their understanding through practical application.

#### Part 5: Mock Interview Preparation

##### Introduction:
To prepare for actual interviews, participants will be given a set of problems to practice that are commonly used in live coding interviews. These will include exercises on data structures and algorithms, system design, and problem-solving.

##### Exercise resources:
- Pramp for peer-to-peer mock interviews on various topics.
- Interviewing.io for practice interviews with hiring managers from top tech companies.
- Coderbyte for accessing a large database of coding challenges and interview prep questions.

##### Final tips:
Participants will receive guidelines on how to approach problems during an interview, including thinking out loud, writing clean and readable code, and efficiently communicating their thought process to the interviewer.
