Provide an extensive multi-section structure for the Sprint 1 Part 1. It should try to:
- present a real-world scenario or multiple scenarios building on top of each other
- present various practical problems with at least one example - real companies, real problems, etc.
- mention how previously introduced tools are insufficient
- introduce new tools, techniques or concepts how to solve these new problems in a pragmatic fashion
-  smoothly transition from one concept to another

You can add, remove or change the order of various sections to ensure there is a logical transition from one idea to another.
