- Can you explain the differences between development builds and production builds?
- Is it possible to modify code in the node_modules folder? If so, why? If not, why not?
- What makes a function or a class easy to test?
- What are the pros/cons of using an integer vs. a UUID as a primary key?
- What does a typical factory function return?

- Which languages are you familiar with? With which language you feel most comfortable?
- Given your familiarity with both Java and TypeScript, what are some key differences between the type systems of Java and TypeScript?
- Which databases have you worked with? How do you generally interact with them? Are there any specific ORM libraries that you have experience in?
- How do you approach testing?

APIs:
- Let's say we have a front-end with TypeScript, how would you suggest adding some type safety to the API calls if you are using Spring Boot in the backend?
- Are you familiar with GraphQL? How would you compare it to REST and when would you consider using it?

Queues:
- I have noticed that you have Apache Kafka in your CV, in what context did you use it?

OOP:
- Explain the difference between interfaces and abstract classes. When would you choose one over the other? Could you provide an example of a situation where you would use an interface and another where you would use an abstract class?
- Since Java is an class-based OO language, can you recall any problems that you solved using OOP patterns?
- Are you familiar with SOLID principles? Could you describe what does
  - Dependency inversion principle
  - Single responsibility principle
  - Liskov substitution principle
mean and how would you apply them in your code?

CS Fundamentals:
- I see you do not have a degree in Computer Science, so I'll give you a basic question about big O notation. What does it mean and how is it used for? Does it mean that the algorithm with the lowest big O notation is always the fastest, assuming big O of time complexity?

Optional:
- In context of Java, what is the difference between streams, threads and processes?
- Do you have any experience with Cloud solutions, such as AWS?
