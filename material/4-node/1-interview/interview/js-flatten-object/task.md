```js
/**
 * Implement a function called `flattenObject` that takes an object and flattens it into a single-level object.
 * The keys of the flattened object should represent the path to the leaf value, separated by dots (`.`).
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * const obj = {
 *   a: 1,
 *   b: {
 *     c: 2,
 *     d: {
 *       e: 3
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * flattenObject(obj);
 * // Output: { 'a': 1, 'b.c': 2, 'b.d.e': 3 }
 * ```
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The input object may contain nested objects.
 * - The function should handle an empty object as input and return an empty object.
 * - The input object may contain arrays, which should be flattened as well.
 *
 * Implement the `flattenObject` function and provide test cases to verify its correctness.
