First, we will revisit some common (and not so common) JavaScript Array methods.

Your task is to refactor some procedural code to functional using array methods
and higher order functions.

1. Run tests

```bash
npm test arrays
```

Then, go through each exercise:

2. Refactor provided functions that have a "TODO:" comment.
3. Make sure all tests still pass.
4. Check and compare your solution with the provided solution. In some cases, you will be provided with multiple solutions to compare and contrast.
