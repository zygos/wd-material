# Introduction to Node.js Streams and Pipes

## The Business Problem

Consider a scenario where you need to process a large CSV file, apply some transformations to its data, and then compress it for storage or transmission. In our particular case, we need to process a CSV file that contains sales data.

Using traditional file handling methods, such as reading the entire file into memory, processing it, and then writing it back, can be memory-intensive and could crash your application if the file is larger than the available system memory.

## Why Use Streams?

Streams in Node.js provide an elegant solution to this problem by allowing data to be processed piece by piece, or "streamed", without the need to load the entire dataset into memory. This approach has several benefits:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: By processing data in chunks, streams significantly reduce the memory footprint of your application, making it possible to handle files that are much larger than the available system memory.
2. **Time Efficiency**: Streams allow for data to be processed as soon as it's read, which can lead to faster execution times as you're not waiting for the entire file to be loaded before starting the processing.
3. **Scalability**: Applications built with streams are more scalable, as they can handle increases in data volume without requiring proportional increases in system resources.

## Exercises Overview

In this series of exercises, you'll get hands-on experience with Node.js Streams and Pipes, starting from a basic implementation without streams and gradually introducing more complexity. Here's what each part covers:

- **0-withoutStreams**: An introductory example showing how to process a CSV file is currently processed without streams.
- **1-createFile**: Learn how to create a file stream.
- **2-createGzipFile**: Add a gzip compression step to the file stream.
- **3-processCsv**: Process a CSV file using streams, applying transformations to its rows.
- **4-remainders**: Deal with the issues when the business-related data is not cleanly split across chunks.
- **5-flush**: Learn how to use the flush function to finalize stream processing and handle any remaining data.

Each step includes a test file and an unfinished solution. You'll complete the provided code snippets and then check your work against the provided solutions in the solution folder for each exercise.

## Notes on when to use Streams

While majority of your REST or RPC endpoints will not need streams, they are a great tool to have in your toolbox.

When working in a professional setting where you will need to decide whether to use streams or not, you will need to consider the problem requirements and constraints. If your problem does not require processing large files or dealing with slow data processors, you might not need to use streams at all.

**Example of a large file processor.** A file upload service, such as YouTube, where you want to start processing the file (encoding to optimized formats and resolutions, checking for copyright issues, etc.) as soon as you start receiving it, rather than waiting for the entire file to be uploaded.

**Example of a slow data processor.** Large language models, such as GPT, takes some time to generate a response. You might want to stream the response to the client word by word, rather than waiting for the entire response to be generated on the back end and then and then sending it all at once to the client.
