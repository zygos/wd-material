# Exercise 5: Flush Mechanism in Stream Processing

## Task Overview

In this final exercise of our series, you will learn about the `flush` method in stream processing. This method is crucial for handling any remaining data that was not processed during the normal operation of the stream. Specifically, you will address the case of handling an unprocessed remainder in the `CsvTransform` class.

## Task

Extend the `CsvTransform` class by implementing the `_flush` method. This method is called once the stream has ended. You `_flush` method should process any remaining data stored in the `remainder` property and push it to the output stream.

## Testing & Solution

Run the provided test cases to verify your solution. Once completed, compare your implementation with the provided solution in the solution folder.
