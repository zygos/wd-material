4. You have imported a Discord bot API package into your Node.js application. It provides a class called `Client` you want to use in your application. However, it is not very convenient to use. You would like an easier way to interact with it, so you write a new class DiscordBot, which interacts with the Discord Client and exposes a few easy-to-use methods for your application. Which OOP pattern did you just use?
a) Adapter
b) Facade
c) Observer
d) Strategy
- Correct: b) Facade

5. When applying the Adapter pattern in software development, what is its primary purpose?
a) To ensure that different parts of a program can operate on different data types interchangeably.
b) To change the algorithm used by an object at runtime.
c) To convert the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients.
d) To aggregate functionalities of individual components into a cohesive whole.
- Correct: c) To convert the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients.

6. The Observer design pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:
a) You need to ensure data consistency across different parts of an application.
b) You have objects that need to be aware of the state changes in other objects.
c) You want to restrict access to certain parts of your application.
d) You need to perform complex transformations on data.
- Correct: b) You have objects that need to be aware of the state changes in other objects.

7. In FP, we can use functions to wrap other functions with additional behaviour. For example: fetchwithCache = withCache(fetch). Which OOP pattern does the same by adding new functionality to an object without altering its structure?
a) Adapter
b) Decorator
c) Observer
d) Strategy
- Correct: b) Decorator

8. Which of the following best describes the Strategy pattern?
a) It defines a skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
b) It allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
c) It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
d) It helps in reducing the number of objects created, to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
- Correct: c) It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

9. What does the `flatMap` Array method do in JavaScript?
a) Merge all arrays contained within an array into a single array.
b) Apply a given function to each element of an array and flatten the result by one level.
c) Map each element of an array to a new array and concatenate them.
d) Flatten an array of arrays by two levels.
- Correct: b) Apply a given function to each element of an array and flatten the result by one level.
