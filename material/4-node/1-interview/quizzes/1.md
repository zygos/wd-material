Q8. Your application runs on 10 Node servers. However, any user in your application can request to generate 1000s of reports.

- a) Use streams to process the reports in chunks
- b) Use a shared buffer to save on memory usage
- c) Use a message queue to distribute the workload
- d) None of the above
