## TypeScript types (6 hours)

We will go through an refresh our knowledge of TypeScript by answering the following questions:

- Quiz: [Standard TypeScript types](https://learntypescript.dev/03/l8-quiz) (10 min)
- Quiz: [Creating Types](https://learntypescript.dev/04/l10-quiz) (10 min)

If you get less than 7/10 out of any of these quizzes, go through the corresponding chapter, in particular the parts that you got wrong in the quiz. If you managed to get a high score on both quizzes, investigate your mistakes (if any) and proceed to the Classes section.

- [Using Classes](https://learntypescript.dev/05/intro) (1 hour)
