Part 2: Intermediate TypeScript

# Part introduction

In Part 2 of our Intermediate Node.js concepts sprint, we're diving into the heart of TypeScript's more sophisticated features - the ones that might have given you a headache before. ü§ï Yes, we're talking about those intriguing yet sometimes perplexing concepts like type generics, advanced types, and immutability. You've probably encountered them, used them, and maybe even struggled to fully wrap your head around them. But worry not! This part of the sprint is designed to transform that struggle into strength. üí™

We'll kick things off with a refreshing quiz to gauge where you stand with TypeScript types and then swiftly move on to unravel the mysteries of classes, generics, type narrowing, and more.

By the end of this part, you'll have a deeper understanding of these intermediate concepts and how to apply them effectively in your Node.js projects, making your code more robust, readable, and downright impressive. üåü

# Key learning topics & resources for this part

## TypeScript types (7.5 hours)

We will go through an refresh our knowledge of TypeScript by answering the following questions:

- Quiz: [Standard TypeScript types](https://learntypescript.dev/03/l8-quiz) (10 min)
- Quiz: [Creating Types](https://learntypescript.dev/04/l10-quiz) (10 min)

If you get less than 7/10 out of any of these quizzes, go through the corresponding chapter, particularly the parts you got wrong in the quiz. If you managed to get a high score on both quizzes, investigate your mistakes (if any) and proceed to the Classes section.

Then, continue with the following chapters:

- [Using Classes](https://learntypescript.dev/05/intro) (1 hour)
- [Generic types](https://learntypescript.dev/06/intro) (2 hours)
- [Type Narrowing](https://learntypescript.dev/07/intro) (1 hour)
- [Mapped types](https://learntypescript.dev/08/intro) (1 hour)
- [Conditional types](https://learntypescript.dev/09/intro) (1 hour)
- [Immutable types](https://learntypescript.dev/10/intro) (1 hour)

## TypeScript exercises (2 hours)

- [Exercises](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GoQaCVPrC13cvUMZUmHt0r2kNRk9bBQ/view?usp=sharing) (2 hours)

Download the exercises that combine the TypeScript knowledge you have learned so far with some Node.js and Express knowledge. Both exercises provide tests, hints, and a solution.

# Directions for further research (1 hour+)

- The concept of "Duck Typing" is often applied in JavaScript due to its dynamic nature. Can you provide examples where duck typing enhanced or created challenges in a project?
- How do TypeScript's types compare to type systems in other typed languages (e.g., Java, C#, Rust)?

## Optional: TypeScript challenges (2.5 hours)

- [Start at TypeScript solutions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFfL2azrshE&list=PLOlZuxYbPik180vcJfsAM6xHYLVxrEgHC&index=1) and the [Hellow World warm up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tusmoNUOGoA&list=PLOlZuxYbPik180vcJfsAM6xHYLVxrEgHC&index=2) (20 min)

Do not start working on all the challenges at once. We have picked a few relevant challenges for you to start with.

**Note on challenge difficulty.** The challenges are divided into easy, medium, and hard. However, that does not mean that even easy challenges will be easy. They are easy if you already a TypeScript wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è For our purposes, even the provided "Easy" challenges are plenty! This is beyond what you would need in any live coding environment. These challenges are here to stretch your understanding of generics, mapped and conditional types.
