1. What distinguishes WebSockets from traditional HTTP communication in terms of message flow?
a) WebSockets can only send messages from the client to the server.
b) WebSockets allow for bidirectional, real-time communication between the client and server.
c) HTTP allows for real-time, bidirectional communication inherently.
d) WebSockets require manual polling by the client to retrieve messages.
- Correct: b) WebSockets allow for bidirectional, real-time communication between the client and server.

2. What does the process of 'long polling' involve in the context of real-time communications?
a) Clients continuously request updates from the server at rapid intervals.
b) The server sends updates to the client at predetermined intervals.
c) The client makes a single request, and the server takes its time to respond until there's new information.
d) Data is pushed from the server to the client in real-time without any request from the client.
- Correct: c) The client makes a single request, and the server takes its time to respond until there's new information.

3. What is a practical limitation when using WebSockets in applications with many Node instances?
a) Increased memory usage on the client side.
b) WebSockets can only work on a single Node instance.
c) Difficulty in synchronizing events across multiple instances.
d) The limitation of a single WebSocket connection per client.

4. How does using WebSockets affect the statefulness of a web application's communication?
a) It makes communication entirely stateless.
b) It introduces a stateful communication channel between the client and server.
c) WebSockets communication is stateless but can be made stateful through additional protocols.
d) It has no impact on the statefulness of communication.
- Correct: b) It introduces a stateful communication channel between the client and server.

5. You're considering using a WebSocket library like Socket.io for your application. What are some key differences between Socket.io and the lower-level 'ws' package?
a) Socket.io supports automatic reconnection and can fall back to long-polling if WebSockets aren't available.
b) Socket.io provides features like rooms and namespaces for message organization.
c) Socket.io tends to have more overhead than the basic 'ws' package.
d) All other answers are correct.
Correct: d) All other answers are correct.

7. Scenario: You need to choose an approach for a real-time bidding system within an online auction application. Users need immediate updates on current bids, and the potential number of interactions is very high. Which of the following is the most suitable choice?
a) Short polling
b) Long polling
c) Server-Sent Events (SSE)
d) WebSockets
Correct: d) WebSockets

8. You're adding a WebSocket-powered chat to a web app with existing user authentication. How do you ensure only authorized users can send and receive messages over the WebSocket connection?
a) Pass an authentication token in the initial WebSocket handshake
b) Rely on the server's IP address filtering to allow only known clients
c) Have the client re-authenticate every time a message is sent
d) WebSockets cannot be used in applications requiring authentication
Correct: a) Pass an authentication token in the initial WebSocket handshake

9. A client sends a malformed message to your WebSocket server, causing an error. How do you ensure the WebSocket connection remains open for other clients?
a) Implement try-catch blocks around message processing logic on the server.
b) Write robust client-side validation to prevent malformed messages.
c) Use a load balancer to handle failing WebSocket instances.
d) Malformed messages will always crash the entire WebSocket server.
Correct: a) Implement try-catch blocks around message processing logic on the server.

10. Your users would like to see who is actively typing a message within the chat application. How might you implement this functionality using WebSockets?

a) The server could periodically poll the database to check for updated timestamps on draft messages.
b) WebSockets are not well-suited for broadcasting typing status in real-time.
c) Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) in addition to WebSockets for this specific feature.
d) Have clients send a "typing started" event through the WebSocket when they begin typing, followed by a "typing stopped" event.
Correct: d) Have clients send a "typing started" event through the WebSocket when they begin typing, followed by a "typing stopped" event.
