    "content": "Turing College offers multiple weekly stand-up meetings for learners, inspired by popular daily scrum meetings in the IT industry. These are led by a Senior Team Lead and are designed to help learners build a community, discuss topics, practice speaking, and get study help, rather than serving as status reports. These meetings are a fundamental part of the learning experience at Turing College and are scheduled on the platform's calendar."

It's great practice for asking effective questions, which is a crucial skill for both learning at Turing College and working in the tech industry."

    "content": "Tips for Open Sessions. 1. Prepare questions in advance. JTLs can help you learn to find answers independently, so share your thought process and troubleshooting steps. 2. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback on your questions. 3. It's okay if questions don't come naturally. View the process of finding good questions as an active learning exercise. 4. Use your Intra calendar to join sessions. You don't need to attend for the entire duration. 5. Be polite to others in the session. Offer insights if relevant or ask the JTL to message you when they're free. 6. Open session schedules are posted on Discord."
