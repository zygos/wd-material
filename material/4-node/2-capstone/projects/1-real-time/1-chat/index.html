    // WebSocket is a global object in the browser.
    // Note - it uses the ws:// protocol, not http://.
    // This is a different protocol with a lower overhead
    // than HTTP, which makes it suitable for real-time
    // communication.
    // However, it requires additional setup on the
    // server side if you need to support HTTP and WebSocket.
    // Also, in deployed applications you would want to
    // use the secure wss protocol instead of ws, similar
    // to how you use https instead of http.
