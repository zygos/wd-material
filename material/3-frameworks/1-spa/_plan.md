### Sprint 3: Single Page Applications

This sprint will equip learners with the skills to build robust Single Page Applications (SPAs) using Vue 3. They will explore JavaScript packages and npm, Vue Router, build tools like Vite, linting with ESLint, SCSS for styling, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) through unit tests on the front-end.

#### Part 1: Package Management, Build Tools, and Linting

1. Exploring JavaScript Packages and npm
- Introduction to JavaScript Packages (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Dive into npm
- Installing and using packages and how to use flags
- Understanding package.json and package-lock.json
- Exercise: Set up a JavaScript project with npm and install a package.

2. Building with Vite
- Introduction to Build Tools
- Getting started with Vite
- Exercise: Initiate a Vue 3 project using Vite and explore the project structure.

3. Keeping Code Clean with ESLint
- What is Linting and why it matters
- Introduction to ESLint
- Configuring ESLint for a Vue project
- Exercise: Set up ESLint in your Vue project and fix linting errors.

4. Styling with SCSS
- CSS Vs. SCSS: A comparison
- Introduction to SCSS
- Exercise: Refactor some of your project's CSS to SCSS.

#### Part 2: Diving into Vue 3

1. Getting Started with Vue 3
- Introduction to Vue 3
- Understanding Vue Composition API
- Exercise: Create a simple Vue 3 application using the Composition API.

2. Component-based Architecture
- Dive into Vue 3's component-based architecture
- Exercise: Develop a multi-component Vue application.

3. Exploring Vue's Reactivity
- Reactivity in Vue 3
- Exercise: Create a reactive Vue application with dynamic data.

4. Directing with Vue Directives
- Understanding Vue Directives
- Exercise: Use Vue directives to manipulate the DOM in your application.

#### Part 3: Testing and Routing in Vue

1. Test-Driven Development on the Front-end
- The importance of Testing
- Introduction to unit tests in Vue
- Exercise: Write unit tests for your Vue components.

2. Routing with Vue Router
- The role of routing in SPAs
- Introduction to Vue Router
- Exercise: Implement routing in your Vue application.

#### Hands-on: Building a Personal Portfolio
Learners will use their new skills to build a personal portfolio website. The portfolio will include a homepage, about page, projects page, and a contact page. Learners will be encouraged to make the portfolio personal by adding their own projects, bio, and professional details.

#### Practical Project: Movie Watchlist App
For the final project, learners will combine all the skills they've learned into building a movie watchlist app. The app will allow users to search for movies, see details, and add them to a watchlist. They will use Vue 3, Vue Router for navigating through the app, and unit tests to ensure the application works as expected. The project will be styled using SCSS, and ESLint will be used to ensure the code is clean and follows best practices.
