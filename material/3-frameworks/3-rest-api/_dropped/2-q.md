Some tips:

- by convention, databases use `snake_case` for column names, while JS/TS uses `camelCase` for property names. There is nothing inherently wrong with using `snake_case` in JS/TS, but it is a less common practice. You can use `kysely`'s [CamelCasePlugin](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/CamelCasePlugin.html) to automatically convert `snake_case` to `camelCase` and vice versa.
- you can look into `kysely-codegen` package to generate TypeScript types from your database schema. If you decide to use it together with `CamelCasePlugin`, you will need to add `--camel-case` flag to the `npx kysely-codegen` command.
