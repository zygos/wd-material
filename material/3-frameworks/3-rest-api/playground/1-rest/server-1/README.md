## Migrations

Before starting our application, we need to run migrations to sync the database to an expected schema. We can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run migrate:latest
```

## Running the server

In development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```
