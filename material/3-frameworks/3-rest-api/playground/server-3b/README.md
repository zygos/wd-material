## Setup

**Note:** For this exercise, we have provided an `.env` file with the database connection string. Normally, you would not commit this file to version control. We are doing it here for simplicity and given that we are using a local SQLite database.

## Migrations

Before running the migrations, we need to create a database. We can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run migrate:latest
```

## Running the server

In development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Updating types

If you make changes to the database schema, you will need to update the types. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run generate-types
```
