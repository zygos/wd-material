8. Imagine there are two isolated tests. In the 1st test, we spy on our console.log function. In the 2nd test, we stub it. What will we observe when we run each test? Assume that tested modules call console.log and no other console methods are used.
a) Only the 1st test will print logged messages to the terminal
b) Only the 2nd test will print logged messages to the terminal
c) Both tests will print logged messages to the terminal
d) Neither test will print logged messages to the terminal
- Correct: a) Only the 1st test will print logged messages to the terminal

10. What is the difference between a mock and a stub in strict testing terminology?
a) A stub provides a canned implementation of a dependency that returns values
b) A mock provides a canned implementation of a dependency that returns values
c) A stub is never actually used inside the tested module, but it is used to fill parameter lists
d) A stub allows checking for how it was called, while a mock usually does not allow that
- Correct: a) A stub provides a canned implementation of a dependency that returns values
