Part 5: Refined Habit Tracker

In this assessed part, you will upgrade your previously written JavaScript habit tracker with TypeScript, unit tests, and E2E tests.

This part should address any issues you have in your current application while migrating it to TypeScript and covering the main user flows in E2E tests. Whenever a function performs some non-trivial logic, add a unit test for that function.

## New Technical Requirements

1. Use TypeScript for your Vue 3 habit-tracker application.
2. At least 4 E2E tests that cover the main user flows.
3. At least 2 unit tests for non-trivial functions.

**Optional bonus challenge:**

Instead of using `localStorage` to store habit records, use a Node server with an SQLite database to store and retrieve habits and their daily records. This challenge is recommended if you already have some experience with web development and databases. Otherwise, we recommend focusing on the core requirements - TypeScript, testing and fleshing out key features.

## Reviewer role

In this project, you should imagine presenting your web application to a senior developer.

## Project evaluation criteria

- **Habit tracking functionality.** The application tracks and stores user habits, marking habits as completed, and includes your custom feature.

- **Unit and E2E Tests.** Learner has tested the application's main features.
- **User experience.** The application is pleasant, intuitive, and easy to use.
- **Ease of making changes.** The application is modeled in a way that allows new developers to change or add features easily.

## Questions

During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.

**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask:**

- How have you improved your application since the previous sprint?
- How have you considered your application from the user's perspective?
- How can a user navigate across days, weeks, and months?
- How did you ensure your application is responsive and accessible to various users?
- How have you tested your application? Are your tests sufficient to deploy the application with confidence?
