We have some utilities for this test file to make our tests more readable, less repetitive, and less prone to bugs due to selector typos.

In practice, a small test file like this would not need additional utilities. Tests do not need to be as DRY as your business logic.

Nevertheless, to illustrate the possible use of utilities without introducing the complexity of a larger test suite, we have added some utility functions while still dealing with a small component.
