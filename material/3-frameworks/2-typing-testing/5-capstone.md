Part 5: Front-end Capstone

Welcome to the second capstone project! ðŸ˜Ž

This capstone project is designed for you to apply everything you have learned about Frontend Web Development to create a unique and interesting web application. This project is open-ended, allowing you to work on a project that aligns with your interests.

## Project description

Start by brainstorming what kind of web application you want to build. It could be an application to solve a problem you or others face or something you find interesting. You can use various packages, UI libraries and APIs to create powerful and interactive applications. The project's complexity should be similar to that of the graded project in the previous sprint.

If your idea seems too big or complicated, you can build a minimalistic version known as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This MVP should still be functional and perform at least one prominent feature of the final application.

Spend significant time brainstorming and planning your project. Consult with other learners, JTLs, and STLs to ensure realistic project scope. Your chosen idea and ability to empathize with the final user will be evaluated.

Once you've decided on your project, create an initial architecture plan. This could include pseudocode, diagrams, use-case descriptions, or a list of tasks. Think about the requirements of your application and what types of tests it would need to pass for you to know that you are done. Think about pages that you will need to implement. Your plan doesn't need to be perfect, but it will help guide your development process.

When you're satisfied with your plan, start developing your application. Regularly review what you've learned in this module to ensure you use efficient tools and techniques. You can discuss your code with other learners working on this task and share feedback.

While a deployment to a service such as GitHub Pages, Netlify or Vercel would be a nice addition, it is not required. This is especially true if your application needs private API keys to run.

## Reviewer role

In this project, you should imagine presenting your web application to a potential technical interviewer during a job interview.

## Project evaluation criteria

- The idea and implementation of the project are well-justified. It is possible to see why it could be useful to have an application like this.
- The application is user-friendly and visually appealing.
- The code is modular, organized and follows a clear structure and consistent code style.
- Ability to explain and adapt the code during the correction.
- General understanding of topics from module 2.
- Tested the application's main features that would allow for easy maintenance and further development.
- The quality of the project is worthy of being a public portfolio item.

During a task review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.

**Sample questions for a reviewer to ask**
- What are the main features of your application? How did you implement them?
- How did you ensure your application is responsive and accessible to various users?
- How have you tested your application? Are your tests sufficient to deploy the application with confidence?
