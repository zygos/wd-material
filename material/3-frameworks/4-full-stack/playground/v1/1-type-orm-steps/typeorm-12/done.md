Congratulations you have gone through all the TypeORM exericses!

There is still a lot you could learn about TypeORM and ORMs in general, but it is not necessary for the tasks we will work on in the remainder of this sprint.

If you have managed to complete all the exercises, you should know enough to move on to the next part. See you there!
