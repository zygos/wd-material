## Setup

Add the connection string to your PostgreSQL database in the `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.

## Migrations

Before running the migrations, we need to create a database. We can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run migrate:latest
```

## Running the server

In development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Updating types

If you make changes to the database schema, you will need to update the types. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run gen:types
```
