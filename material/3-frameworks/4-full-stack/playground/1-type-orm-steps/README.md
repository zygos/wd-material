## Setup

`npm install`

Start with the first numbered exercise folder `typeorm-1`.

1. Run `npm test typeorm-1` to start tests for the exercise. Tests will fail.
2. Read the `exercise.md` file in the folder.
3. You can investigate the tests to ensure you understand what is expected. Tests will also show some methods of querying data from the database with a repository.
4. Solve the exercise to get the tests to pass.
5. Move on to the next folder.

Each folder builds on the previous one, and each folder is a solution to an earlier exercise. For instance, `typeorm-2` is a solution of the exercise in `typeorm-1`.

If you get stuck and can not solve the exercise, ask for help. If that does not help, look for the solution in the next folder. Each solution includes some comments describing it.
