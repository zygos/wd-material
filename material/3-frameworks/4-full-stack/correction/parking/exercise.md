Parking Charge Calculator.

Write a function `calculateParkingCharge(arrival: Date, departure: Date)` calculating the parking charge based on parking duration:

- parking between 8:00 - 18:00 costs 2 euro per hour
- every other time costs 1 euro per hour.

It should always round up to the nearest hour. For example, 2 hours 1 minute rounds up to 3 hours.

Parking can be overnight. You can assume your local timezone.
