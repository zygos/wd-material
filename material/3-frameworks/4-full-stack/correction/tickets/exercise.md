**Ticket Discount System**

Implement a function that calculates the ticket price for a cinema.

- Regular tickets are â‚¬12.00.
- Seniors (aged 65 and over) and children (aged under 12) get a 30% discount every day.

- Cinema wants to capitalize on nearby university having no classes on Wednesdays afternoon. To incite students, they provide a 20% discount for adults 25 and under on all Wednesdays.

The function accepts the following parameters:

- age: number
- date: Date (of purchase)

If necessary, the ticket price should be rounded to the nearest cent.

You can assume your local time zone.
