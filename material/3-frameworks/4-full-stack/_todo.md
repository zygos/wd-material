- Turi bÅ«ti Ä¯dÄ—jÄ™s Ä¯ peer programming project. There must be commits from at least 2 people.

Hey team! Popping in to remind you that while we've pushed back the deadline for Sprint 2, it's important not to get too caught up in polishing the Discord bot. Remember, the TDD peer programming exercise is equally essential to getting the most out of this sprint. To wrap up the sprint successfully, you will need to link your peer programming GitHub repository in your sprint project's README file. So go and grab a partner or two, and good luck with the exercises. ğŸ¤
