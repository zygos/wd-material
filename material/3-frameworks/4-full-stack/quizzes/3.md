1. What is the primary purpose of hashing user passwords before storing them in a database?
a) To encrypt the password so that it can be decrypted later
b) To transform the password into a fixed-size string for database uniformity
c) To ensure the password is kept secret from database administrators
d) To protect user passwords in case of a database breach by making them difficult to guess

2. Why is the difference between a salt and a pepper in password hashing?
a) A pepper is kept with the hash; a salt is stored separately.
b) A salt is unique per password; a pepper is secret and can be global.
c) A salt enhances password complexity; a pepper is an encryption algorithm.
d) A salt is a secret key; a pepper is a public key.
- Correct: b) A salt is unique per password; a pepper is secret and can be global.

3. What is the main difference between authentication and authorization in the context of web security?
a) Authentication verifies who the user is, while authorization determines what resources a user can access
b) Authentication and authorization are interchangeable terms in web security
c) Authentication is a form of encryption, while authorization is a form of decryption
d) Authentication determines what resources a user can access, while authorization verifies who the user is
- Correct: a) Authentication verifies who the user is, while authorization determines what resources a user can access

4. What is the primary reason for setting an expiration time on JWT tokens?
a) To force users to regularly update their passwords
b) To limit the time window an attacker has to use a compromised token
c) To reduce the size of the JWT token
d) To synchronize with user session timeouts in the database
- Correct: b) To limit the time window an attacker has to use a compromised token
- Topic: JWT

5. Why is it recommended to use bcrypt over directly using a hashing algorithm like SHA-256 for password hashing?
a) Bcrypt is faster and requires less computational resources
b) Bcrypt automatically handles salt generation and has a more secure slow hashing function
c) Bcrypt uses encryption instead of hashing, which is more secure
d) Bcrypt allows for more complex passwords
- Correct: b) Bcrypt automatically handles salt generation and has a more secure slow hashing function

6. What is a JWT token's structure typically composed of?
a) Header, Payload, and Signature
b) Algorithm, Salt and Data
c) Key, Value, and Expiry
d) Public Key, Cost factor, and Bearer
- Correct: a) Header, Payload, and Signature
- Topic: JWT
- Difficulty: Basic

7. Password A is hashed with bcrypt cost factor of 10, and password B is hashed with a cost of 20. It took 1 second to hash password A. How long would it take to hash password B, approximately?
a) 1 second
b) 2 seconds
c) 10 seconds
d) 1000 seconds
- Correct: d) 1000 seconds

8. Who can read the contents of a JWT token?
a) Only the server that issued the token
b) Only the client that received the token
c) Only the user who knows the password for decrypting the token
d) Anyone who has access to the token
- Correct: d) Anyone who has access to the token
- Topic: JWT

9. In case of a successful XSS attack, an attacker can perform requests on a user's behalf. So what is the difference between an application that stores its token in localStorage and an application that stores it in an httpOnly cookie?
a) Because httpOnly cookies are inaccessable to JavaScript, cookies completely prevent XSS attacks.
b) localStorage tokens can be accessed via JavaScript, allowing the attacker to use the token outside of the user's browser.
c) httpOnly cookie prevents an attacker to perform requests on a user's behalf even if they have access to user's browser.
d) Unlike cookies, tokens in localStorage are not automatically sent with every request, so the attacker cannot use them.
- Correct: b) localStorage tokens can be accessed via JavaScript, allowing the attacker to use the token outside of the user's browser.

10. When using tokens for authentication, why is it highly recommended to use HTTPS instead of HTTP?
a) HTTPS is faster and more efficient than HTTP
b) HTTPS encrypts the token, making it unreadable in transit
c) HTTPS allows for larger payload sizes, which is necessary for tokens
d) HTTPS is required for a token to be valid
- Correct: b) HTTPS encrypts the token, making it unreadable in transit

12. What does the term "salt" refer to in password security?
a) A secret static string of characters added to the password before hashing
b) Random data fed as an additional input the hashing function
