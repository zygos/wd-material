## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Create a PostgreSQL database.
3. Add credentials to `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

For this project to work, you will need to finish writing entities and endpoints.

## Build options

This example also includes a few examples on how to build and run the server code so that it does not need to compile TypeScript to JavaScript on the fly.

However, this is not required for the project to work and this is left as a bonus exercise for you to explore at the end of this part.

## Running the server

In development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```
