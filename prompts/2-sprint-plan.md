You work in a tech education startup. You are a senior web developer who has been tasked with creating a web development course for new students.

## Course Goals

- Turn people into high-quality junior web developers that companies will genuinely want to hire.
- Allow people to become knowledgeable in both FE and BE, but truly specialize in either one with a specific tech stack. This should allow people to outcompete other generic juniors that are "full-stack".
- Teach about the culture and the mindset of web developers, which will make it easier to fit into web development teams and be comfortable even in their first job.
- Teach core soft skills needed for a successful career as a web developer.

## Course Structure
The course consists of 4 modules: 3 core modules and a specialization module. Each module consists of 5 sprints. A module is expected to take 150 - 200 hours.

Many parts will also have "directions for further research" – prompts to guide learners toward a more personalized learning experience based on their interests and goals. They are meant to ensure that each learner has the opportunity to develop their unique strengths instead of everyone going through the same steps and resources. Finally, each project at the end of the sprint will expect a learner to have done some further research.

A sprint is expected to take 1 - 2 weeks (depending on background knowledge and time spent per week).

In total, the course will require ~800 hours, spending ~20 hours / week for ~10 months.

<!--- SYSTEM --->
I'm writing the structure for Module 2: Basics of Frontend Web Development. By the end of the module, students should deliver a Vue 3 project by using functional programming patterns, build tools (Vite or Webpack), E2E tests (Cypress), code linting, localStorage, an external API (or APIs), and Gitflow (or a variation of it).

The sprints are as follows:
- Sprint 1: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and Gitflow
- Sprint 2: Introduction to JavaScript and Functional Programming
- Sprint 3: Single-Page Applications (SPAs) & Introduction to Vue 3
- Sprint 4: Advanced Front-end Tools and Techniques

Here's my course plan for the 1th sprint:

```markdown
#### Sprint 1: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and Gitflow
1. Internet
- TCP/IP
- DNS
- HTTP, HTTPs
- curl

2. HTML
- Introduction to HTML
- HTML tags and elements
- Basic page structure
- Accessibility best practices
- Inspecting structure with Dev tools
- Advanced: Media elements
-> Quiz

3. CSS
- Introduction to CSS
- Syntax, classes, pseudo-classes, properties, and variables
- Selectors and specificity
- CSS layout techniques (flexbox, grid)
- Media queries
- Simulating devices with Dev tools
- Advanced: CSS preprocessors
-> Quiz

4. Hands-on: Build a simple static website
- Planning website content
- Creating HTML structure
- Mobile-first CSS styling
- Adding pictures, video embeds
- Implementing accessibility best practices
-> Hands-on (Collaborating with Gitflow)

5. Practical project: Personal Portfolio
- Create a personal portfolio showcasing your skills and projects
- Implement mobile-first design with responsive layout
- Ensure website follows accessibility guidelines
- Use Gitflow to manage project versioning
-> Graded project
```

Heavily expand each item with nested subitems into a structured Markdown document. This will be used later to write the course material.
