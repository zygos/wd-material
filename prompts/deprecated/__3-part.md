You work in a tech education startup. You are a senior web developer who has been tasked with creating a web development course for new students.

Information on the course:
"""
## Course Goals

- Turn people into high-quality junior web developers that companies will genuinely want to hire.
- Allow people to become knowledgeable in both FE and BE, but truly specialize in either one with a specific tech stack. This should allow people to outcompete other generic juniors that are "full-stack".
- Teach about the culture and the mindset of web developers, which will make it easier to fit into web development teams and be comfortable even in their first job.
- Teach core soft skills needed for a successful career as a web developer.

## Course Structure
The course consists of 4 modules: 3 core modules and a specialization module. Each module consists of 5 sprints. A module is expected to take 150 - 200 hours.

Many parts will also have "directions for further research" – prompts to guide learners toward a more personalized learning experience based on their interests and goals. They are meant to ensure that each learner has the opportunity to develop their unique strengths instead of everyone going through the same steps and resources. Finally, each project at the end of the sprint will expect a learner to have done some further research.
"""

The course consists of multiple modules. Today we'll focus on Module 2 (Front-end web development).

Here's a course plan for front-end module (Module 2):
- Sprint 1: Introduction to HTML, and CSS
- Sprint 2: Introduction to JavaScript and Functional Programming
- Sprint 3: Single-Page Applications (SPAs) & Introduction to Vue 3
- Sprint 4: Advanced Front-end Tools and Project Management
- Sprint 5: Web Application

Today, we'll focus on the Module 2 Sprint 1. Sprint 1 consists of the following parts:
1. Internet
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Hands-on: Radio Shack Redo
5. Practical project: Personal Portfolio

## Part 2: Conditionals

### Part description

Congratulations on completing the first part! You can already be proud that you have started writing your code in Python. Next, we will continue learning more about how some of the core concepts in programming work – conditional statements.

We will also delve a bit deeper into debugging your code. By now, you will have written some code that resulted in errors. It is essential to try to understand those errors and have the tools to find them.

### Key learning topics & resources for this part

#### CS50P - Conditionals (2 hours)

Remember to write the code you see yourself. Also, try to do some experimenting. For example, when watching the part about if and elif, you might ask yourself a question – can you have if statements within if statements? Try it out!

#### Debugging (2 hours)

- [Debugging Python in VSCode - 01 - Intro to Debugging in VSCode](...)
- [Debugging Python in VSCode - 02 - Step Over Line of Code](...)
- [Debugging Python in VSCode - 03 - Step Into and Step Out](...)

Besides giving some great tips on debugging your code, we would also like to use this video as an illustration and exercise for another thing you are likely to encounter very often, both when learning and when working as a web developer. The instructions and guides you see often have some small (or not small at all!) discrepancies compared to what you see on your computer. You will inevitably need to learn how to deal with such situations, as frustrating as they might be. However, with time you will get an intuitive understanding of what parts you can freely tinker with to get the desired results.

The words "tinkering" or "experimenting" are particularly fitting here – a developer will often try different things that might potentially work without being entirely sure of what will happen, look at the results, and move towards a solution this way. And yes, in some cases, you might break things this way – but it is expected, and you should not be too afraid of it (although evaluating the risk of what you can break is another useful skill you will get good at)! If you do break something – it just means that you will need to find a way to fix it – a new challenge, but something that will likely lead to additional valuable insights and learning as well! A vital thing separating a novice developer from a senior one is often not the general knowledge about how "things should be done right" - it is the experience and the capability to identify why things go wrong and how to solve that!

In this particular video, you might notice that once the button with the play and bug icon is pressed on the left, there are immediately tabs called "Variables", "Watch", and "Call stack". However, something else might appear if you click the same button in your online version of VS Code. The tabs will not be there (although such things can change quickly - it could be possible that when you are reading this, everything will work exactly as in the video! Do let Turing College know if that's the case :) ). Your exercise, in this case, is to tinker with VS Code to try and find out how to reach the same kind of tab on the left as you see in the video and how to then perform the debugging just as in the video (you should be able to write and understand a program identical to what is being shown).

Try to do this as soon as you reach this part of the video. If you get genuinely stuck (this can be a tough exercise, mainly depending on how your environment works), try to use the open sessions, stand-ups, and Discord to get help and move on to the CS50P Problem set.

Some hints:
- Try to notice all the errors that are being shown;
- Google the errors if you are not sure what they mean (if the error is significant, you might want to google only the part which you think is the most relevant);
- Depending on the error you get, you may need to use some of the knowledge you gained in the last part regarding the command line, precisely determining the location of files.
- .json is a standard file format for controlling a program's settings. You should try to understand if a .json file controls the debugging part and if some changes could be needed. The errors present a hint regarding what needs to be changed.
- You might find a different way to solve the issue without using the hints above.

### Exercises

- [CS50P - Problem set 1 (3 hours)](...)

Solve and submit all five problems.
