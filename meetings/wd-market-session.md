Hi Web Developers! @WD_learners
Curious about the job market or recent trends? Join our exclusive online session with industry experts.
We'll discuss:
ðŸš€ Is there a downturn in the Web Dev market?
ðŸš€ Will AI replace web developers?
ðŸš€ Comparing Turing College learners to industry juniors.
ðŸš€ Tips for job searching success.

## Intro

Å½ygimantas.
- Co-founder of Appmakers, a web development agency, sometimes freelancing, and apparently curating material for Turing College on the side.
- Not a fan of long-term jobs. Often working on exploratory projects. Some active, some passive income.

## Panel chat

- Lithuanian market: PHP, Symfony, C, Java. There are 2 PHP meme stereotypes - scripters that drag the entire salary average down and "lambo" developers that are paid well.
- Startup stack: Next.js + Tailwind + Express.

From hiring perspective, what are companies looking for the most in junior developers? Obviously people will lack experience in working with teams and on larger projects, so what would be your tips on becoming more attractive in the job market? There's also concern that we'll have to compete with university graduates who might not have touched some of the technologies that we use, but probably has better understanding of lower level computing.

Interview:

- Intelligence, problem-solving skills.
- Soft skills. Do I foresee any issues with this person?
- Stack-specific skills.
- Excitement for the job.

TC portfolio projects.

- Back-end:
  - Java

- For an entry position, by definition, your competition does not have much to show. You are not expected to have an extensive portfolio.
- Your competition is quite bad.
- Take-home task, live interview.

Turing College capstone projects are more than enough, especially if you work on a problem you are interested about. Hopefully we can have a portfolio website with a capstone projects.

- If your primary reason for switching to web development is the salary, then you are in for a bad time.
- Systematizing the learning process is important.

Some want to radically change their profession (at least me) and choose programming. Is there a big difference in what a person used to do before starting WD? Does it affect the job search? Is it a common question, why did you decide to change your profession? And does age matter?

- If you switch careers. You could have a very rare intersection of skills that is very valuable. Instead of just being a developer, you could be a developer with a background in finance, for example. Imagine how much more valuable you are to a fintech company. The further you are from the standard "development" background, the more unique you are in the market.

- Systematizing nature, pattern recognition, good at maths.
  - I am quite surprised by the number of people that are not in the industry.

### Is there a downturn in the Web Dev market?

Market conditions:
  + A large part of the hiring drought is caused due to the market correction to the post-COVID tech boom due to shortage of online systems. It is important to know that the job cuts in IT companies do not mean that all of that, or a majority of developers are released. A large chunk of the cuts can be attributed to cutting support staff.
  + Lithuania has been a beneficiary and a victim of tech offshoring.
  + The market salary growth has stagnated for some time. Anything IT is still a standard deviation or two above the average salary for most other professions, especially in Lithuania.

Long-term trends:
  + A broader perspective in the industry
  + During 2000 dot-com bubble bust, the industry took a hit. During the 2008 crisis, web development salaries also experienced a downwards correction. However, if you could time travel and advise someone doubtful about the future of web development, you would tell them to stick with it. The industry has always bounced back.

### Will AI replace web developers?

+ I find it to be an accelerator for the learning if its not abused for assignments.
+ Developers with AI will replace developers without AI, because "Software Is Eating the World" and there is a lot of the world left to eat.
+ AI right now even unlocks new disruptive possibilites that need additional developers, including web developers.
+ It teaches to approach problems from the outside - documentation, comments, interfaces, types, maybe even test-driven development. If you get that right, then you can get the AI to do the rest.

Software applications themselves are just a series of explanations of what to do. If you can explain it to a computer, you can explain it to a human.

- With AI, you will have to move to the mid-level positions earlier than previously. I speculate that focus will shift from coding and scripting that would be enough for entry positions, but now, more of building solutions in general. Programming is not about finding the words to type out, but of building the appropriate model of world that correctly matches the problem you are trying to solve.
- Solution designers. Blacksmiths used to come up with the design and then implementing it. Now, the technology has eliminated the need to do many things by hand. The paradigm of "artisan developer" developing new small representational websites is on its way out. However, web development seems to migrate to more generic "solution designer".

### Turing learners

  + You won't believe how many developers are bad. In fact, that might be the major issue, that AI obfuscates the difference between good and bad developers.
  + Especially if you are freelancing, you will not believe how bad the competition is. Then you need to prove your value.
  + I think we are teaching the right skills in TC to be able to compete in the market.
  + Small artisant websites.
  + We are not teaching jQuery, WordPress on a shared PHP server, etc.
  + We made the decision to teach the skills for web application development and not web "site" development.

  + Above the market's junior position level. In some regards, leading TC learners are between junior and entry mid-level.
  + You might be better off not boxing yourself into a junior position.
  - If you do your best, go through Turing College, get the most out of it. Then you will not need to worry about how to "hack the system". Your only problem is how well you are able to showcase your skills.
  + Through standups I heard through the great vine, that a 4 - 5 already got accepted to junior positions, at least Vinted academies, paid internships. Vinted, Danske, Swedbank...

### Tips for job searching success

- Be open to different roles and stacks. Some learners have applied to back-end positions with Java. You might need to look up different stacks.
- Be resilient, for no profession would you expect to get a dream offer right out of the gate. Half of the time, it's a mental game.
- Temper salary expectations.
- Upwork. Though competition is fierce, it's a decent place to start.
- Look for clients that have a history or will need to develop lots of projects. You will make most of your money on larger clients.
