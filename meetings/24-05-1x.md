Content updates for Mod 3 will depend on how we will decide to proceed with the restructuring of the curriculum in version 3.

I already have some drafts for migrating ORM to Module 4, but it's tricky as it's easier to remove than to find a place for it in Module 4.

- Deployment-dedicated OS, with the idea of making a video that could be part of the curriculum.
- Teaching how to setup JavaScript/TypeScript projects in the back-end.
- For the front-end module, we are relying on Vite, which is sufficient.

Open sessions for deployment.

The Oding Project as core for Module 1.

Odin course in itself has a structure that makes sense. They have practical tasks, sometimes they don't.
Sections vary in size, but they do make sense.

Turing has its own Module, Sprints, Parts structure. This creates confusion for students.

1. I recommended for learners - make Module 1 easier, shorten the course:

- OOP
- Regular Expressions

1. Get rid of Vue stuff. Use a short intro to React.
  - Specialisation in React.

Giedrius likes the ideas.
