Standup:

1. Started on the hands-on solution for the back-end material. Trying out new stuff by myself.
  A new JS runtime, Bun, has just hit a 1.0 version, which kind of indicates it's ready for production.
  It's fun. It's quite a bit faster and in many ways more ergonomic than Node. I hope that Bun becomes a viable
  choice for back-end development in the future. I even considered using it as a teaching tool, because it removes so
  many unnecessary complexities from running JS in a professional environment.
2. Got a lot more outside work. New interesting projects, working with clients, etc. so the FAQ/live coding session might be delayed.

Question:
- How do you choose what kind of packages and tools to choose in a personal project?
