Andro:
- difficult 1st part; error handling took more than 0.5h; when is it a good time to use 'finally'?
-> consider throwing out `finally` from the course
- issues finishing the JS part.

Question:
- push
- shift -> index; don't use 'shift'

- finish JS first sprint
- went through quite fast, started 2nd part

- upset that there's no back-end
-> have taken too many extensions;
- How is everyone's feeling about the gaps between working on the challenges and the lectures?

Luka:
- JS third part; liked higher-order functions
- filter + map
- will have vacation
- Tic Tac Toe will be easy??
- Question: how the Tic Tac Toe logic works?
- Human vs Human is the easiest;

- wants to use OOP. Classes, static methods, getters, setters.
