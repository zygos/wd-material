Standup:

1. Submitted back-end project.
2. Planned out upcoming material. Taking a break on Turing stuff for a week or so.
3. Going back to some client stuff, I need to plan out some major.

Questions:
- What is the use of Nginx? And can we setup it for any level of project and it works fine as a server handling requests?
- Is it possible to deploy a frontend project to Docker? If yes, what files should be deployed?
- In what cases it makes sense to use ORM instead of writing SQL queries directly? Will we be learning an ORM, if so which one? Will we be learning additional database, if so which one?
- What runtime environments are recommended for handling CPU-intensive operations, besides Node.js?
- How would you estimate the time necessary for a project when requirements and possible implementation are ambigious?
