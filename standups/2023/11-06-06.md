Standup:

Working on finalizing the 3rd BE sprint. Trying to simplify the material a bit.
  - Though very important to note that your goal is not to get comfortable with all these tools, but to get familiar with them. Try out, experiment.
  - Had issues with one of the APIs for one of the clients, didn't have to track that down. One client is asking for a large feature estimation. There is one very annoying API call issue that might involve the network layer or something of that sort.
  - Client is asking to estimate one large feature set, you know, copying their competitors.
  - Also some there is far out planning about specializations. Whether I will be doing them, depends on our our terms with Turing College.

Questions:
  <!-- - What would you define as a single responsibility? -->
  <!-- - What are the pros/cons of slicing your application by technical concern vs services? -->
  - What are the limitations of SPA applications? What are the best use cases for SPA applications?


I have 10 years of web development experience. I specialize in full stack JavaScript development and that is well reflected in the material.
