Standup:

0. Thank Katya for the SQL session. I had a student who was in your session and I definitely think that helped. I think we should consider having recorded sessions even.
1. Finalizing the 2nd BE sprint, going through WD 3 corrections. Having issues nailing down the difficulty level. So, still quite uncertain whether the next jump in difficulty will be too much. A live session would possibly help a lot here, but I am starved for time.
2. It will include lots of hands-on practice. Just a long 70 hour hands-on.
3. After that I will need to switch to another project to deal with project estimation and planning, so I will need to figure out a way on how to get the material in some quicker manner.

My question:
- When you might prefer a NoSQL database over a SQL database?

Standups:

## Luca

- A little bit knowledge on SQL. What was interesting that it's possible using a database for job management. Crons. It can be used for shared operations. Looking into ACID principles.
TODO: add details on ACID
- Questions:
  - When is it possible to DROP COLUMN in a SQLite database?

## Evaldas

- Had my STL correction. Issues with configurations.
- Questions:
  - There are issues with referencing transpiled files in TypeScript. Where would you include them?

## Eyob

- Reading the documentation. Want to update questions. SPA returns a white page.
- Questions:
  - What is the use of PHPMyAdmin?

  <!-- - PHPMyAdmin. What year is it? -->

## Akvilė

- Talked to herself when learning SQL to remember the commands. It helped a lot for the live interview. The more I expose myself to it, the better I get at it.
- Questions:
  - How to optimize SQL queries to improve performance?

## Liis

- Practiced a lot writing queries. Looking forward. Had my first week in other school week. There we used PHP, Laravel, MySQL and MariaDB. Queries are not that different.
- Questions:
  - What are composite primary keys. When could we use them and how do they impact performance?
