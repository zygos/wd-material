- What is the main difference between mocks and stubs?
- Can Dependency Injections be preferred over mocks?
- I saw this built in middleware in one of the video in course material. It looks like this: express.urlencoded(). In what cases we should use it?
- Could you expand more on the material updates we already went through? Is there some places in the course worth revisiting now?
