Standup:

  Agency work:
  - Tied some loose ends with a few long-lived issues. One with payments, one with external APIs. There is still some minor damage control due to some incorrect payment amounts.

  Turing:
  - More or less done with Node Specialization Sprint 2 with a RAG chat application. Pretty happy how that turned out and how it combines quite a few things on Node.js specialization.
  - I expect to start taking Node specialization reviews this week. This will require some special preparation as 1st sprint in Node is a mock tech interview that is a level above the previous interiew-like reviews.

  Personal projects:
  - Looking to migrate some vector embeddings in a personal project. Hopefully, finishing Turing stuff will leave more time for that.

Questions:
  - Unasked: What stack would you choose for a personal project?
