Standup:

  - Right now I am dealing with a nasty bug with client's payment code, there was an untested case when some tax, some inflation, discounts and recurring payments all come into contact. So right now I am clearing this up with accounting to decide what is the correct way to handle this case.
  - At the same time, some client work and a preliminary estimation for a client project.

  Turing:
  - Making corrections for back-end Sprint 3, which is the furthest anyone has gotten yet.

  - Working with a pair of new STLs on **upcoming specializations**.
  - Working on Module 4 specialization material myself, though I am taking my time.

Questions:
  - What would be a good approach to allow the client to query data using flexible criteria?

## Miglė

- Went through TS utilities types, now I understand those types quite a bit more. Some TS types really complex that use a few extends and nesting. Used TDD for everything I did. Now I see better the benefits of TDD. I really see how it saves time. I started a Discord bot. We did not have enough time for debugging.

- Last week I worked on peer programming exercise. I agree with Miglė on TDD, things make a lot more sense. The only thing that I did not figure out yet is **decrementing tickets**. I might leave it for later.
- Questions:
  - I would like to setup debugging. Test doubles. I would like to see the real examples based on our exercises with fake data that we provide.
