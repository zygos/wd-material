Standup:

  Turing:
  - Finished the Node Specialization Sprint 2.
  - I expect to start taking Node specialization reviews this week.

  This week:
  - Planning out some initial ideas for the v2 version of the course. Possibly changing everything from Module 1 to 4. Or, it might mean just some limited updates to the current material.

  Agency:
  - Some work on tasks that were not high-priority. Well, technically, you only have high-priority and very high-priority tasks, so that doesn't mean much.
  - Prepare documents for a financial statement.

  Personal projects:
  - On my free time, looking to migrate one of my personal projects away from AWS. It's a bit too expensive for what it does.

Questions:
  - Unasked: What stack would you choose for a personal project?
