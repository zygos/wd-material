Standup:

  ## Previous week:

  Agency:
  - Slower week agency-wise.

  Turing:
  - Took a few days off, so updated only Module 3 Sprint 3 & 4 content. So, this week it is time to update the final sprint and to prepare more instructions on mock interviews.
  - Been talking with other STLs about changing the mock technical interview process. Right now, it's just too short and it might apply correctly to all students.
  - We already have the first student finishing the course.

  ## This week:
    - I have heard that some learners are worried about AI impacting the software development. What are your thoughts on how artificial intelligence will impact web development?

## Artūras

- Managed to deploy it.
- Did some E2E testing. That did not went too well. I am also using Firebase storage.
- When I tried to run my tests, my tests kept uploading multiple images to external storage.
- Questions:
  - If E2E tests are supposed to test the application as a whole, it seems unavoidable that we have to interact with external services. How do you handle this in your tests?

## Miglė

- Did not manage to get much progress. Custom hooks were quite difficult to understand. I do not understand when to use custom hooks. Not clear when I should use React Hooks. React Context is quite straightforward to understand. Also, it was interesting to see how React looks with class components vs. functional components. I am glad we are learning functional components.
- Questions:
  -- Encapsulating some state and behaviour, especially if it is something that can be abstracted away from the UI.

## Svetlana

- React uses lots of event listeners. How does the context work.
- Questions:
  - I recommend going to open sessions, I think there are some React-focused open sessions. Or you could ask me for JS-focused open sessions.

## Katya

- Finished one big work project. Teaching people how to use it. It's amazing how people were dealing with various tools like MS Office, but they still don't know the basics, such as copy and paste. Now, I will have more time to focus on my learning.
- Last week I had some people from my batch:
  - One found a job as an intern in Danske, as QA. QA is a more secure job. Interviews went quite well, coding sessions were quite easy. You are not supposed to find a solution. You should explain things step-by-step. Not so hard-core.
  - Vinted, software engineer. They did some additional tasks.

- If e2e is testing the app as a whole, what should we do if it seems that it is unavoidable not to interact with external sources?(in my case tests were uploading file to storage)
- Has anyone tried to refactor previous React projects by adding custom hooks? Where did you find use cases for them?
-
- AI

Two doomers:

- AI will replace developers, especially junior developers?
- AI can help developers to progress in their careers.
- AI helps to learn faster, to find solutions faster.

- Is QA a more secure carrier path than web development?
