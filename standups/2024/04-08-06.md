Standup:

  ## Previous week:

  Agency:
  - Slower week agency-wise, could delegate most tasks to other developers, so I could dedicate more time to Turing.

  Turing:
  - Working on lots of small and not so small updates to the material.
  - Trying to apply these changes to current content, especially Module 3.

  ## This week:
    - Working on the solution guide for the Node hands-on.
    - Working with Turing Staff to propagate these changes to the current content.
