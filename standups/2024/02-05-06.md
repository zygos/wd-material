## Miglė

- PostgreSQL, TypeORM, tRPC, passwords, authentication, authorization, and more.
- **I do not entirely get creating relations in PostgreSQL.**
- Questions:
  - What's **CORS** and why do we need it and specifically for tRPC?

## Svetlana

- PostgreSQL and TypeORM, a little bit confusing for relationships.
- Questions:
  - What are serial generated and UUID generated primary keys? What are the differences and when to use one or the other?

## Artūras

- Finished Discord bot. I tried to do TDD. **I believe it's easier on the BE than on the FE**. Once you get one route, other are more or less the same. The part with ęrd party packages came in, so that was quite a bit harder.
- Questions:
  - In the case of server, is it fine to return only the status code. Or should there be a status message as well? For example, for errors?
  - NO QUESTION PREVIOUS WEEK!

- What is CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) and why do we need it when building RPC APIs?
- What are the differences between SERIAL vs. GENERATED AS IDENTITY vs. UUID?
