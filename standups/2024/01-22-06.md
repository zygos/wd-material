Standup:

  - Some client stuff, some legal work for a client launching a project. Likely, there will be a need for some GDPR-specific user management features.

  Turing:
  - Found at least one STL for BE Sprint 3, so I am phasing out my corrections for BE Sprint 3.
  - Working on my own Module 4 specialization material, trying out to restructure how to lay out the material based on what I have observed so far. Right now I am focused on material on more intermediate Node concepts and patterns.

  - On PHP specialization side, it seems that we have refined the initial material a bit more, so we are leveraging what you have learned so far.
  - The React side seems to be going well.

Questions:
  - What would be a good approach to allow the client to query data using flexible criteria?
