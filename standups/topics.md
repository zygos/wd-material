Building a mental model of what you are trying to learn through sheer exposure to high quality examples.

Before you can learn a new skill, you need to build a circuit in your brain that will recognize what is "good" and what is "bad". In the most colloquial sense, you need to develop taste. Taste precedes skill.

1. Give yourself enough examples of whatever you are trying to learn. This builds your ability to categorize, to differentiate between what you like and what you don't. This applies to design, code, etc.
2. This will not, on its own, teach you HOW to do things, but it will guide you as you'll start developing good/bad feelings about some designs or code. As long as these feelings are not of attachment, you'll be fine.
3. When developing you notice that something doesn't feel right, but you can't really put your finger on it, OR you know where the problem lies but you don't know how to fix it. Everytime you notice that:
  -> write that down
  -> bring it up during standups or corrections
4. This will evolve over time.

In practice:
  - For design, that used to be Dribbble. Every Sunday, I'd have 15 minutes of browsing Dribbble.
    - Alternatives: Behance sometimes, though that is more geared towards showing off your portfolio to other designers and design agencies.
    - It's also possible to use Pinterest, Facebook, but it seems to have a bit too much "recycled" content.
  - For coding, it's a bit more tricky. But GitHub or YouTube tutorials is decent place to start. Though, you have to be somewhat selective. If you find some small, relatively new project, check out its codebase. You will need to learn to read other codebases and investigate packages to debug some nasty issues.

<!-- Where to find good code examples? -->

I generally prefer abstract topics, trying to teach general concepts and ideas instead of bringing additional tools.

What do you find speeds up your learning process the most, especially when learning a new topic?

- Start with an ideal solution first, work from there.

I had a personal project last week and to a large extent this past weekend that I had to finish quickly. I know, that I personally like to overwork small details up to a point where I feel the solution is exactly what I want. But applying this sort of strategy is not not the best when pushed against a deadline. I anticipated that this would be an issue and I decided to work breadth-first instead of depth-first. So, building a basic product where everything kind of works. Nothing that I would be proud of. Then I used the remaining time to build on top of the result until I got ~80% of what I'd like. It's better to have 100% of the things working at 80% of the quality than 80% of the things working just the way you like it and the remaining 20% just not working at all.

As time goes by, I start learning about my personal pitfalls so I try to adjust my strategy to avoid them. It's something I recommend everyone here to do as well. Try to identify your personal inclinations and how these could bite you if you're not careful. Then build a strategy to course correct.
