[x] JS packages -> Node Sprint 1 || Paminėti, kad kaip optional resource
[x] Remove references of TypeScript from SQL + Node sprint. TypeScript
[ ] Node: Direction for further research. Apie Express.
[x] Front-end Capstone išmesti, tiesiog projektas.

- Simplify Node + SQL?

- Module 1 was quite easy.
- Starting from Module 2.2 was quite hard - speed typing test.
  - Difference between modules. Material was not enough. We had to build a complex project. We had to do quite a bit of our own research.
- Material seems to be not enough, I need to spend quite a bit of time on my own.
- Needs a lot of simplyfication a lot.

---

Notable:

- [x] Heavily simplified Node SQL hands-on. Instead of CSV export/import, you need to make a Node server with 2 endpoints. Much simpler hands-on, as previously it was one of the biggest headaches for all learners to understand what was going on.
  - [x] Update Node hands-on description - Todo
  - [x] New Node hands-on solution - Todo
  - [x] New Node hands-on - Todo solution description
- [x] Removed the entire deployment part from Front-end Typing & Testing sprint. It takes too much time. It will be enough for students to learn about CI/CD only during the final back-end sprint.
- [x] Instead of the front-end capstone, learners will be upgrading the previous habit tracker app they have written in previous sprint. They will upgrade it by migrating it to TypeScript, adding unit and E2E tests.
- [x] All projects migrated to ES Modules.
- [x] Updated a bunch of dependencies.
- [x] Use 'node:' prefix for built-in Node modules.
- [x] Simplify back-end building, bundling and deploying the project to production.
- [x] Update material to use ES Modules and "node:"
- [x] Add "prod" script
- [x] Grammar check
- [ ] Upload files to the Google Drive.
- [ ] Add links to files.
- [ ] Update the Google Doc.
- [x] Update web 1.1 hands-on solution according to STL feedback.

Major changes:

Module 2:

[ ] To smooth out the difficulty curve and bridge FE and BE concepts, the Node SQL hands-on was significantly simplified. Instead of CSV export/import, learners will now create a Node server with a few endpoints. The new hands-on is much simpler and more straightforward.

Module 3:

[ ] > To simplify FE project configuration, Stylelint is now optional for all projects.
[ ] > To reduce the complexity of the final project, the front-end capstone was removed. Instead, learners will upgrade their previous habit tracker app by migrating it to TypeScript, adding unit and E2E tests.
[ ] Removed "Deployment" part from the Front-end Typing & Testing sprint. Learners will learn about CI/CD during the final back-end sprint.
[ ] Updated dependencies and GitHub Actions versions.
[ ] To address some common pain points when deploying a project to AWS, we have provided more guidance and provided some ready-to-go scripts for building projects and running migrations.

---

MUST: update FE project criteria to include technical requirement for JS, TS, unit and E2E testing.

---

[ ] Simplify first JS hands-on. Right now the use of async and supporting multiple games seems too much.
[ ] Make stylelint entirely optional
[ ] Do not require learners to setup GitHub Actions - provide it as a given in most projects.
[ ] Truputį stipriau atskirti SQL nuo Node.js.
[ ] Anksčiau išmokyti kaip apjungti FE ir BE.

Priority:

- v2
- Tada ORM iškelti į Node specializaciją.
- Tada v3.

---

v2 - Greičiau, daugiau žmonių pajustų benefit.

Module 3 Node vieną sprint perkelti į Module 4 specializaciją.

TypeORM -> Node specializaciją.

---

- TODO:

Ne Python, o JS pirmame Modulyje.

[ ] Pirmo modulio plan'ą?
[ ] Antro modulio aptrimm'inti
  - JS
[ ] Trečio modulio aptrimm'inti
  - ORM
  + TS
[ ] Perkelti į front'o specializaciją

Kad kuo greičiau 3.1 pabaigtų.
- jQuery
- SSH, susikurti key + Docker

+ Debug

---

Pushinam kuo greičiau v2 make or break:

- Web Development course structure duplicate (V2)
